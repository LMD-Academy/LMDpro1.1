# LMDpro Assessment Structure Guide

This document outlines the general approach to assessments within LMDpro courses. It serves as a guideline for AI when generating new course outlines, helping it create content conducive to effective learning checks.

## 1. General Principles

- **Alignment:** Assessments should directly align with the learning objectives of the module/course.
- **Variety:** Employ a mix of assessment types to evaluate different kinds of knowledge and skills.
- **Formative & Summative:** Include both formative assessments (to guide learning) and summative assessments (to evaluate learning).
- **Authenticity:** Where possible, assessments should reflect real-world tasks and challenges.
- **Feedback:** Provide timely and constructive feedback to learners.

## 2. Assessment Types by Level (Conceptual)

This informs the AI about the complexity of understanding expected from generated module overviews.

*   **Level 1 (Beginner - Foundation):**
    *   Focus: Knowledge recall, basic comprehension.
    *   Types: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs), true/false, short answer questions (SAQs), simple matching exercises.
    *   AI Guidance: Content overviews should cover foundational concepts clearly, suitable for direct questioning.

*   **Level 2 (Intermediate - Development):**
    *   Focus: Application of concepts, basic analysis.
    *   Types: Scenario-based MCQs, SAQs requiring explanation, simple case study analysis, fill-in-the-blanks with context.
    *   AI Guidance: Content overviews should hint at comparative ideas or application contexts.

*   **Level 3 (Professional - Specialization):**
    *   Focus: In-depth analysis, problem-solving, evaluation.
    *   Types: Complex case studies, short essay questions, problem-solving tasks, project-based assignments (conceptual for outline generation).
    *   AI Guidance: Overviews can allude to more complex scenarios, frameworks, or decision-making processes.

*   **Level 4 (Senior / Extremely Advanced):**
    *   Focus: Synthesis, strategic evaluation, complex decision-making.
    *   Types: Strategic case analyses, policy recommendations, simulation-based tasks (conceptual).
    *   AI Guidance: Overviews can imply strategic challenges, multi-faceted problems, and need for high-level synthesis.

*   **Level 5 (Executive / Extremely Difficult):**
    *   Focus: C-suite strategic thinking, navigating ambiguity, leadership judgment.
    *   Types: Capstone projects, strategic challenge analysis, board-level report simulations.
    *   AI Guidance: Overviews should reflect high-level strategic imperatives and complex, ambiguous challenges.

## 3. AI Generation Guidelines for Module Overviews

When AI generates module overviews, it should consider:
- What are the core concepts a learner should grasp?
- How might these concepts be applied or tested practically?
- Does the overview lay the groundwork for questions that assess recall, application, or analysis, appropriate for the target difficulty level?

This guide helps the AI generate module outlines that are not only informative but also lend themselves well to the creation of meaningful learning assessments.
