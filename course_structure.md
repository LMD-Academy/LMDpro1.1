# LMDpro Enhanced Course Structure Guide

This document outlines the preferred structure and pedagogical approach for courses within the LMDpro platform. It serves as a guideline for AI when generating new course outlines and for organizing existing content.

## 1. Hierarchy

Courses are organized as follows:
- **Field:** Broad subject area (e.g., Leadership & Management Fundamentals, Agile Business, AI Specialization).
  - **Standalone Course:** A comprehensive course within a Field (e.g., Introduction to Modern Management, Autonomous AI Agent Development).
    - **Sub-Course (Module):** Specific learning units within a Standalone Course (e.g., The Evolution of Management Thought, Foundations of Autonomous AI Agents).
      - **Lesson:** An individual teaching unit focused on a single concept or a few closely related concepts within a Module.
        - **Activity:** The actual content or task a user engages with in a lesson (e.g., Reading, Quiz, Assessment, Interactive Scenario, Project).

## 2. Content Principles for Sub-Courses (Modules) & Lessons

- **Clear Learning Objectives:** Each module and lesson should have clear, actionable learning objectives.
- **Practical Application:** Emphasize real-world application, case studies, and examples.
- **Engaging Content:** Use a mix of text, interactive elements (quizzes, scenarios), and practical exercises.
- **Structured Sections:** Break down content into logical sections with clear headings (H1-H6 in Markdown).
- **Concise Overviews:** Each Field, Standalone Course, and Sub-Course (Module) should have a brief overview (1-3 sentences) summarizing its content and purpose. Lesson overviews can be integrated into the module content.
- **Appropriate Difficulty and Length:** Clearly indicate estimated difficulty (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Professional, Senior, Executive) and length (in hours or pages, or by number of activities for lessons).
- **Skills Awarded:** Identify specific skills learners will gain upon completion of modules or courses, to be integrated with the Resume Builder.
- **Assessments:** Modules should have quizzes for formative assessment, and Standalone Courses should have summative exams/assessments.

## 3. AI Generation Guidelines

When generating new course structures, the AI should:
- Propose relevant Field, Standalone Course, Sub-Course (Module), and Lesson titles based on the user's query or strategic content goals.
- Generate concise overviews, difficulty levels, and estimated lengths for each component.
- For Sub-Courses and Lessons, outline potential key topics or learning objectives.
- Adhere to the file path conventions (e.g., `EducationalMaterial/Modules/module_title_slug.md` for Sub-Courses). For Lessons and Activities, these would typically be part of the Sub-Course's AEM file.
- Ensure generated content is distinct and offers a unique perspective if related to existing topics.
- Consider how the content might lend itself to various assessment types (as guided by `docs/assessment_structure.md`).
- Suggest appropriate icons for course/module listings where applicable from `lucide-react`.
