## About The Project

LMDpro is a next-generation eLearning platform built with a modern tech stack to provide a seamless and intelligent user experience.

The platform is designed with a "dual operating system" in mind:

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
- npm, yarn, or pnpm

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/lmdpro.git
    cd lmdpro
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    - Create a `.env` file in the root of your project.
    - Add your Google AI API key. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
    ```env
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    ```

### Running the Application

This project requires running two separate development servers: one for the Next.js frontend and one for the Genkit AI backend.

1.  **Start the Next.js development server:**
    Open a terminal and run:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the main application, typically available at `http://localhost:3000`.

2.  **Start the Genkit development server:**
    Open a *second* terminal and run:
    ```sh
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```
    This starts the Genkit AI flows, typically available at `http://localhost:3500`. The Next.js app is configured to proxy AI requests to this server.

You can now access `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to see the application.
