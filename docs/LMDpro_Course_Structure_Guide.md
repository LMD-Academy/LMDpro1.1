# LMDpro Course Structure Overview

This document provides a human-readable overview of the courses and learning paths available on the LMDpro platform, as defined in the `course_data.md` file (which contains the JSON structure). 
It is dynamically generated by the LMDpro application if this documentation view is accessed.

_Content reflecting the current course structure will be populated here by the application if rendered dynamically. As a static file, this serves as a placeholder for that dynamic content._

The LMDpro curriculum is organized into several hierarchical levels:

1.  **Fields of Study:** Broad subject areas (e.g., "General Core Studies Level 1", "Agile Business and Project Management", "Technology Development", "Executive Leadership Level 5").
2.  **Standalone Courses:** Comprehensive courses within a Field, typically composed of multiple sub-courses/modules (e.g., "Foundational Business Skills L1", "Agile Project Management with Scrum L3"). Each Standalone Course has learning objectives, an estimated length, difficulty, and may award a badge upon completion.
3.  **Sub-Courses (Modules):** Individual learning units within a Standalone Course, focusing on specific topics (e.g., "Introduction to Business & Management Principles", "Scrum Roles & Responsibilities"). Each sub-course has its own learning objectives, overview, estimated length, and may include quizzes or link to specific skills awarded.

**Key Information Stored for Each Level:**

*   **Fields:** `id`, `name`, `overview`, `fieldId`, `standaloneCourses` (list).
*   **Standalone Courses:** `id`, `title`, `fieldId`, `overview`, `difficulty`, `length`, `badgeAwarded`, `assessmentPath`, `subCourses` (list).
*   **Sub-Courses (Modules):** `id`, `title`, `filePath` (to the .md content file), `overview`, `difficulty`, `length`, `standaloneCourseId`, `fieldId`, `quizPath` (optional), `learningObjectives` (list), `skillsAwarded` (list of skill objects).

This structured approach allows learners to navigate from broad fields to specific modules, understand prerequisites, and track their progress towards achieving mastery in various professional domains. The platform also supports AI-generated courses, which follow a similar structural pattern to ensure consistency and pedagogical soundness.
