# AI Features in LMDpro

LMDpro leverages advanced Artificial Intelligence, powered by Google's Gemini API family, to enhance your learning experience and provide dynamic content generation capabilities. This document explains some of the key AI-driven features you'll encounter.

## 1. AI-Powered Search & Dynamic Course Generation

LMDpro's search functionality is designed to help you find exactly what you're looking for. If you search for a course or topic that isn't currently in our extensive catalog, our AI steps in to assist you.

**How it Works:**

1.  **Initial Search:** When you enter a search query, the system first looks through our existing curated courses and content.
2.  **AI Course Creation (If No Match):** If a direct match isn't found, LMDpro utilizes the Gemini API (typically `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17` or a similar model appropriate for complex generation tasks) to dynamically generate a new course outline tailored to your search query. This process involves:
    *   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** The AI analyzes your search query to understand the underlying intent and subject matter.
    *   **Content Synthesis (Guided by LMDpro's Framework):** The AI draws upon its vast knowledge base to create a relevant and structured course. To ensure the generated content aligns with LMDpro's pedagogical standards and structure, the AI is provided with specific system instructions. These instructions are conceptually derived from LMDpro's internal guidelines on course structure (akin to a `course_structure.json` which would define hierarchies like Fields, Standalone Courses, Sub-Courses/Modules, preferred pedagogical approaches, etc.) and assessment design (akin to an `assessment_structure.md` which would inform about typical assessment types and learning check considerations for different course levels). This guidance helps the AI generate module overviews that are conducive to learning and potential assessment.
    *   **Course Outline Generation:** Based on your query and these guiding principles, the AI constructs:
        *   An appropriate **Field** (either new or an existing one if relevant).
        *   A new **Standalone Course** complete with an overview, suggested difficulty level, and estimated length.
        *   Several **Sub-Courses (Modules)** within that Standalone Course, each with its own overview, difficulty, length, and ideas for potential learning objectives. These modules primarily contain AI-generated overviews and will use a generic image related to the topic. The file paths for these generated sub-courses are conceptual, as the content is generated on-the-fly and stored in the application's state for the session.
3.  **Integration:** The newly generated course structure is temporarily added to the course list for the current session.
4.  **Availability:** You will see a status message indicating that the AI is generating the course, and once complete, it will appear in the **Course Catalog** (often highlighted or at the top of the list) and become selectable for further exploration.

**Example:** If you search for "Ethical Considerations in Quantum Machine Learning," and no such course exists, the AI will attempt to create a course structure with relevant modules, guided by LMDpro's educational framework documents.

**Benefits:**
*   **Relevant Learning:** Get access to learning material outlines on virtually any topic you search for.
*   **Structured Content:** AI-generated course outlines follow LMDpro's pedagogical structure.
*   **Immediate Exploration:** New course outlines become available quickly, expanding your learning horizons.

## 2. AI Assistant (Chat)

Our AI Assistant, available in the right sidebar of the authenticated application view, is powered by Gemini models (e.g., `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17` for general interaction, potentially higher-tier models for subscribers). It's designed to:
*   Answer your questions about course content.
*   Explain complex concepts.
*   Summarize text or module content.
*   Provide general learning support and guidance.
*   Engage in conversational learning.

The AI Assistant leverages chat history to maintain context during your conversation.

## 3. AI-Enhanced Module View (Course Player)

Within the "Module View" where you engage with course content paragraph by paragraph:
*   **Paragraph Audio (Conceptual - Text-to-Speech):** While full AI-generated narration per paragraph is a complex feature requiring dedicated Text-to-Speech (TTS) services, LMDpro provides a button that utilizes the browser's built-in speech synthesis capabilities to read the current paragraph aloud. The voice and language can often be configured in browser or OS settings.
*   **Paragraph Illustration (Conceptual - Image Generation):** LMDpro conceptually uses Google's Imagen 3.0 model to generate an image relevant to the current paragraph's content. Due to the real-time generation costs and complexities, this is currently represented by a placeholder image fetched based on keywords from the paragraph or an alert indicating the feature's intent. A full implementation would involve an API call to an image generation service.

## 4. Library & Research AI Tools

In the "Library & Research" section, when you load a sub-course or conduct research:
*   **AI Summary of Loaded Content:** Get a concise AI-generated summary of the full sub-course content using a Gemini model.
*   **Research Companion (AI-Powered):**
    *   **Find Publications:** Enter keywords, and the AI uses Google Search grounding via the Gemini API to find relevant scholarly articles and publications. It will attempt to provide titles and direct URIs from the search results.
    *   **Identify Trends:** Based on your query or the found publications, the AI analyzes and identifies emerging themes and trends in the subject area.

## 5. Intelligent Resume Builder AI Features
*   **AI Suggestions:** After you input your resume details, you can request AI-powered suggestions. A Gemini model will review your content and provide actionable tips to improve clarity, impact, and ATS (Applicant Tracking System) compatibility, focusing on aspects like action verbs and quantifiable achievements.
*   **Automatic Skill Integration (Conceptual):** Skills learned from completed LMDpro courses are identified. The system will suggest adding these to your resume and can provide AI-generated, concise descriptions (2-5 lines) for each skill, highlighting its relevance.

## 6. AI Customer Service Assistant
*   Located in the "Help & Support" page and as a FAB in the right sidebar.
*   This AI assistant is trained (conceptually) on LMDpro's FAQ, documentation, and common support issues to provide instant answers to technical, billing, or platform-related questions. It uses a Gemini model for conversational interaction.
