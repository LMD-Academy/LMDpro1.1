1.  **Multiple Choice:** Which technology is commonly used to package an autonomous agent's code, libraries, and dependencies into a standardized unit for consistent deployment across different environments?
    a) Git
    b) Jupyter Notebooks
    c) Docker
    d) SQL Databases

2.  **Short Answer:** Briefly describe one advantage of deploying an AI agent in the cloud compared to local deployment.

3.  **True/False:** "Embodied AI" primarily refers to agents that operate exclusively within simulated text-based environments.
    a) True
    b) False

4.  **Fill in the Blank:** The continuous process of tracking an agent's performance, resource usage, and error rates in a production environment is known as ______.

5.  **Short Answer:** What is one key challenge or area of research in enabling effective multi-agent collaboration?

**Answer Key (Illustrative):**
1.  c
2.  One advantage is scalability (cloud resources can be easily scaled up or down based on demand) OR accessibility (can be accessed from anywhere).
3.  b (False. Embodied AI refers to agents, typically robots, that can perceive and act within physical environments.)
4.  monitoring
5.  One key challenge is developing effective communication protocols and coordination strategies between agents, or mechanisms for conflict resolution when agents have differing goals or information.
