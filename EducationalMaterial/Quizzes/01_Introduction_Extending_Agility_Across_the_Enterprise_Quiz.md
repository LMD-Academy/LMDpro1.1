3. Traditional project-based funding can be slow, inflexible, and not aligned with long-term value stream thinking. LPM suggests funding long-lived value streams instead, providing more flexibility and empowering decentralized decision-making within budget guardrails.
4. d
5. A value stream represents the sequence of activities an organization undertakes to deliver on a customer request or create value for a customer. It's important for scaling as it helps organize teams and efforts around end-to-end value delivery, breaking down silos.
