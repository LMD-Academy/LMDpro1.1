# Quiz: Module 3 - Perception and Understanding the Environment

**Instructions:** Answer the following questions to test your understanding of an agent's perception capabilities.

1.  **Multiple Choice:** Which of the following is NOT typically considered a primary modality for agent perception in digital environments?
    a) Textual input (user prompts, web content)
    b) Visual input (screenshots, GUIs)
    c) Olfactory input (smell detection)
    d) Structured data (JSON from APIs, CSV files)

2.  **Short Answer:** How can Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) be used to enhance an agent's textual perception when dealing with large documents?

3.  **True/False:** Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) like GPT-4V allow agents to understand and interpret GUIs solely by analyzing the HTML DOM structure of web applications.
    a) True
    b) False

4.  **Fill in the Blank:** For an agent interacting with web services, responses are commonly returned in structured formats like ______ or XML, which the agent must parse to extract information.

5.  **Short Answer:** What is one key advantage of an agent perceiving information from structured data (e.g., an API response) compared to extracting it from unstructured text on a webpage?

**Answer Key (Illustrative):**
1.  c
2.  RAG can be used to first retrieve the most relevant chunks of text from a large document based on semantic similarity to a query or task, and then feed only these relevant chunks to the LLM for processing, overcoming context window limitations and improving focus.
3.  b (False. MLLMs primarily understand GUIs by analyzing visual information from screenshots, which is especially useful when DOM structure is unavailable or unreliable.)
4.  JSON
5.  Structured data is more predictable and less ambiguous, allowing for more reliable and precise extraction of specific data points once the schema is known, compared to the complexities of natural language understanding for unstructured text.
