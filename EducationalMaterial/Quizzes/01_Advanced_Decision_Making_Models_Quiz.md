**Instructions:** Answer the following questions to test your understanding of advanced decision-making models relevant to executive leadership.

1.  **Multiple Choice:** The "Bounded Rationality" model of decision-making, proposed by Herbert Simon, suggests that decision-makers:
    a) Always have complete information and can evaluate all alternatives perfectly.
    b) Seek optimal solutions by considering every possible outcome.
    c) Make decisions rationally but are limited by their ability to process information, leading to "satisficing."
    d) Rely exclusively on intuition and gut feelings.

2.  **Short Answer:** What is the core idea behind Gary Klein's Recognition-Primed Decision (RPD) model, especially in time-pressured situations?

3.  **True/False:** The "Garbage Can Model" of organizational decision-making portrays decisions as highly rational and orderly processes.
    a) True
    b) False

4.  **Fill in the Blank:** A ______ framework for decision-making often involves clearly defining the problem, identifying criteria, weighting criteria, generating alternatives, and evaluating them systematically.

**Answer Key (Illustrative):**
1.  c
2.  The RPD model suggests that experienced decision-makers often recognize a situation as similar to past experiences and quickly identify a plausible course of action (the first one that seems workable) without systematically comparing multiple options. They then mentally simulate its outcome.
3.  b (False. It portrays decision-making in organizations as often chaotic and a result of somewhat random streams of problems, solutions, participants, and choice opportunities.)
4.  Rational / normative
5.  Understanding these limitations helps executives appreciate that real-world decisions often involve ambiguity, incomplete information, cognitive biases, and political factors. This encourages them to seek diverse inputs, be aware of their own biases, and use structured approaches where appropriate while also valuing experience and intuition.
