Answer Key:
Part 1: 1.c, 2.b, 3.b, 4.c, 5.a
Part 2:
6. Idealized Influence: The leader acts as a strong role model, instills pride, and gains respect and trust; followers want to emulate them.
7. Competence (ability) and Commitment (willingness/motivation).
8. Intrinsic motivation comes from internal satisfaction from the task itself (e.g., sense of achievement, curiosity). Extrinsic motivation comes from external rewards or punishments (e.g., salary, bonus, praise).
9. Ongoing feedback is timely, allows for course correction, reinforces positive behaviors immediately, and prevents surprises during the annual review, fostering continuous development.
10. Any two of: Improved communication, increased collaboration, higher morale, greater commitment to team goals, better problem-solving, increased productivity, lower turnover.
Part 3:
11. The manager should:
    1. Acknowledge the employee's current workload and discuss its impact before assigning new work.
    2. Clearly explain the new project's importance and why they were chosen (leveraging their D4 skills).
    3. Discuss potential reprioritization or temporary offloading of some of their existing tasks to make space for the new project.
    4. Grant significant autonomy (S4 - Delegating style) for the new project, given their D4 readiness for challenging tasks, but ensure they feel supported and know they can ask for help if the overall workload becomes unmanageable.
    5. Confirm their willingness and commitment given the workload adjustment.
