**Part 1: Multiple Choice (Select the best answer)**

1.  Which of the following is typically the FIRST step in a structured problem-solving process?
    a) Generating potential solutions.
    b) Evaluating solutions.
    c) Defining the problem clearly.
    d) Implementing the chosen solution.

2.  Root Cause Analysis (RCA) aims to:
    a) Identify the most obvious symptom of a problem.
    b) Find temporary fixes for a problem.
    c) Determine the fundamental reason why a problem occurred.
    d) Assign blame for a problem.

3.  Which decision-making bias involves overemphasizing information that confirms pre-existing beliefs?
    a) Anchoring Bias
    b) Availability Heuristic
    c) Confirmation Bias
    d) Hindsight Bias

4.  Brainstorming is a technique primarily used for:
    a) Evaluating the risks of a decision.
    b) Generating a large number of potential solutions or ideas.
    c) Analyzing historical data trends.
    d) Implementing a chosen solution.

5.  Critical thinking primarily involves:
    a) Accepting information at face value without question.
    b) Relying solely on intuition and gut feelings.
    c) Analyzing information objectively, identifying assumptions, and making reasoned judgments.
    d) Avoiding complex problems to maintain efficiency.

6.  Describe the difference between programmed and non-programmed decisions.
7.  What is the purpose of using a decision matrix (or weighted scoring model) in the decision-making process?
8.  Explain the concept of "Groupthink" and why it can be detrimental to effective decision-making in teams.
9.  Why is it important to gather and analyze relevant data when solving problems?
10. Briefly describe one technique, other than a decision matrix, for evaluating potential solutions to a problem.

**Part 3: Scenario Analysis (Read the scenario and answer the question)**

11. A customer service team has noticed a significant increase in complaints about long hold times over the past month. Describe a structured problem-solving approach (listing at least 4 key steps) the team manager could use to address this issue effectively.

**Answer Key (Illustrative):**

**Part 1: Multiple Choice**
1.  c) Defining the problem clearly.
2.  c) Determine the fundamental reason why a problem occurred.
3.  c) Confirmation Bias
4.  b) Generating a large number of potential solutions or ideas.
5.  c) Analyzing information objectively, identifying assumptions, and making reasoned judgments.

**Part 2: Short Answer**
6.  **Programmed decisions** are routine, repetitive decisions handled by established procedures or rules, often for well-structured problems (e.g., reordering office supplies when stock is low). **Non-programmed decisions** are unique, poorly defined, and unstructured, requiring custom solutions and often strategic thinking (e.g., entering a new market).
7.  A decision matrix helps to systematically evaluate multiple options against a set of weighted criteria, allowing for a more objective comparison and selection of the best alternative.
8.  **Groupthink** is a phenomenon where the desire for group consensus and harmony overrides a realistic appraisal of alternatives. It's detrimental because it can lead to poor-quality decisions, suppression of dissenting opinions, and failure to consider risks or alternative solutions.
9.  Gathering and analyzing relevant data helps to accurately define the problem, understand its scope and root causes, identify potential solutions based on evidence rather than assumptions, and evaluate the effectiveness of implemented solutions.
10. One technique is a **Pros and Cons List**: For each potential solution, list its advantages (pros) and disadvantages (cons). This helps in weighing the potential outcomes of each option. (Other examples: Cost-Benefit Analysis, SWOT analysis for each solution).

**Part 3: Scenario Analysis**
11. The team manager could use the following problem-solving approach:
    1.  **Define the Problem Clearly:** The problem is a significant increase in customer complaints about long hold times over the past month, leading to customer dissatisfaction. Quantify "significant increase" if possible.
    2.  **Gather Data & Analyze Root Causes:** Collect data on call volumes, average hold times, staffing levels, peak call times, types of inquiries causing long calls, recent system changes, etc. Use techniques like the 5 Whys or a Fishbone diagram to identify root causes (e.g., insufficient staff, inefficient processes, technical issues, lack of agent knowledge).
    3.  **Generate Potential Solutions:** Brainstorm solutions based on the root causes. Examples: hiring more staff, optimizing call routing, improving IVR, providing better agent training, implementing self-service options, adjusting shift schedules.
    4.  **Evaluate and Select Solution(s):** Evaluate the potential solutions based on criteria like cost, impact on hold times, ease of implementation, and customer satisfaction. Select the most promising solution(s).
    5.  **(Implement and Monitor - further steps):** Implement the chosen solution(s) and continuously monitor hold times and customer feedback to assess effectiveness and make further adjustments if needed.
