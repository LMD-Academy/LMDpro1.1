# Quiz: Module 1 - Foundations of Autonomous AI Agents

**Instructions:** Answer the following questions to test your understanding of the foundational concepts of autonomous AI agents.

---

1.  **Multiple Choice:** What is the defining characteristic that distinguishes a modern AI agent from a traditional automation script?
    a) Its ability to execute a predefined sequence of commands.
    b) Its capacity for proactive execution and independent decision-making to achieve a goal.
    c) Its reliance on a graphical user interface for all operations.
    d) Its limitation to only processing textual data.

2.  **Short Answer:** List the five core architectural pillars of an advanced autonomous AI agent discussed in this module.

3.  **True/False:** In an agentic system, the Large Language Model (LLM) primarily functions as a passive knowledge base, similar to how Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is used.
    a) True
    b) False

4.  **Fill in the Blank:** The ______ pillar is responsible for enabling the agent to understand its environment, often through modalities like text, visual input (e.g., screenshots), and structured data.

5.  **Short Answer:** Briefly explain the role of the "Action" pillar (Tool Use) in an agentic system and give two examples of common tools an agent might use.

**Answer Key (Illustrative):**
1.  b
2.  LLM Brain (Reasoning Engine), Perception, Planning, Action (Tool Use), Memory.
3.  b (False. While it uses its knowledge, the LLM in an agent acts as the central orchestrator, reasoning engine, and planner, actively making decisions and selecting tools.)
4.  Perception
5.  The Action pillar allows the agent to interact with and effect change in its environment by invoking specific tools. Examples: Web browser control (e.g., using Selenium), Shell command execution.
