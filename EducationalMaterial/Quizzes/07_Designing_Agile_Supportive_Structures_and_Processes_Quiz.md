# Quiz: Designing Agile-Supportive Structures and Processes (Module 4.2.AB)

**Instructions:** Answer the following questions about designing organizational structures and processes that support agility.

---

1.  **Multiple Choice:** Traditional hierarchical structures often impede agility primarily because they:
    a) Encourage rapid experimentation and learning.
    b) Speed up decision-making and information flow across functions.
    c) Can create silos, slow down communication, and concentrate decision-making power.
    d) Naturally foster cross-functional collaboration.

2.  **Short Answer:** What is the main idea behind aligning organizational structures around "Value Streams"?

3.  **True/False:** "Communities of Practice (CoPs)" are formal, temporary project teams assigned to deliver specific features.
    a) True
    b) False

4.  **Concept:** Briefly describe one characteristic of an adaptive organizational model (e.g., Holacracy, Spotify Model inspiration, Team of Teams) that contrasts with traditional hierarchies.

5.  **Short Answer:** How can traditional performance management systems hinder Agile ways of working, and what is one way they might be adapted to be more Agile-supportive?

**Answer Key (Illustrative):**
1.  c
2.  The main idea is to organize teams and resources around the end-to-end flow of activities required to deliver a specific product or service (value) to a customer, thereby reducing handoffs, improving communication, and accelerating value delivery.
3.  b (CoPs are groups of people who share a common interest or expertise and collaborate to share knowledge and improve skills, often cutting across formal team structures.)
4.  Example: Distributed authority (Holacracy) - Decision-making is spread across roles and circles rather than concentrated at the top. / Cross-functional, autonomous squads (Spotify) - Small, self-organizing teams with end-to-end responsibility for a feature or service.
5.  Traditional systems often focus on individual annual goals and ratings, which can discourage collaboration, risk-taking, and rapid feedbackâ€”all key to Agile. An adaptation is to incorporate continuous feedback, team-based objectives, and recognize learning and collaboration alongside individual contributions.
