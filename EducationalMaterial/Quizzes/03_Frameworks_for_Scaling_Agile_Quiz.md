# Quiz: Frameworks for Scaling Agile (Module 4.1.AB)

**Instructions:** Answer the following questions about common frameworks used for scaling Agile.

---

1.  **Matching:** Match the scaled Agile framework with its key characteristic or construct.
    *   Frameworks: A) SAFe, B) LeSS, C) Nexus, D) Scrum@Scale
    *   Characteristics:
        1.  Emphasizes a "Scrum of Scrums" and fractal scaling, with distinct Product Owner and Scrum Master cycles.
        2.  Focuses on a Nexus Integration Team and managing dependencies for a single Product Backlog across 3-9 Scrum teams.
        3.  A comprehensive, configurable framework featuring Agile Release Trains (ARTs) and Program Increment (PI) Planning.
        4.  Advocates for a single Product Owner for the entire product and scaling Scrum principles with minimal added roles or artifacts.

2.  **Short Answer:** What is an Agile Release Train (ART) in the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), and what is its typical duration for planning and delivery (Program Increment)?

3.  **True/False:** Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS) aims to be as prescriptive as possible, providing detailed roles and processes for every aspect of scaling.
    a) True
    b) False

4.  **Multiple Choice:** Which role in SAFe is primarily responsible for facilitating ART events and processes, and coaching the ART in its journey towards high performance?
    a) Product Manager
    b) Business Owner
    c) Release Train Engineer (RTE)
    d) System Architect

5.  **Short Answer:** What is a key difference between how Nexus and LeSS approach the Product Owner role when scaling Scrum for multiple teams working on one product?

**Answer Key (Illustrative):**
1.  A-3, B-4, C-2, D-1
2.  An ART is a long-lived, self-organizing team of Agile teams (typically 50-125 people) and other stakeholders that incrementally develops, delivers, and where applicable operates, one or more solutions in a value stream. A Program Increment (PI) is typically 8-12 weeks.
3.  b
4.  c
5.  LeSS advocates for one Product Owner for the entire product, even with multiple teams. Nexus also has one Product Backlog but the Nexus Integration Team, which includes the Product Owner, helps coordinate. The emphasis in LeSS on a *single* PO managing the *single* Product Backlog is very strong.
