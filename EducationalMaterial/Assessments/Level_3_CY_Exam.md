# Level 3 Exam: Cybersecurity (CY)

**Instructions:** Answer all questions thoroughly. This exam assesses your integrated understanding of cybersecurity fundamentals, threats, network security, cryptography, risk management, incident response, and security governance covered in Modules 3.1.CY, 3.2.CY, and 3.3.CY.

**Part 1: Multiple Choice (Select the best answer)**

1.  The "CIA Triad" in cybersecurity refers to which three core principles?
    a) Control, Integrity, Access
    b) Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
    c) Compliance, Investigation, Authentication
    d) Cryptography, Identification, Authorization

2.  Phishing is a type of attack that primarily relies on:
    a) Exploiting software vulnerabilities.
    b) Overwhelming network resources (DDoS).
    c) Social engineering to trick users into revealing sensitive information.
    d) Installing malware through infected hardware.

3.  Which network security device is primarily designed to filter traffic between networks based on predefined rules?
    a) Router
    b) Switch
    c) Firewall
    d) Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

4.  What is a key difference between symmetric and asymmetric cryptography?
    a) Symmetric uses two keys (public/private), while asymmetric uses one shared key.
    b) Symmetric is slower than asymmetric for bulk encryption.
    c) Symmetric uses one shared secret key, while asymmetric uses a pair of keys (public/private).
    d) Asymmetric cryptography cannot be used for digital signatures.

5.  In cybersecurity risk management, risk is often conceptualized as a function of:
    a) Threat, Vulnerability, and Impact.
    b) Cost, Time, and Scope.
    c) People, Process, and Technology.
    d) Prevention, Detection, and Response.

6.  Which phase of the typical incident response process focuses on stopping an attack from spreading further?
    a) Preparation
    b) Identification
    c) Containment
    d) Eradication

7.  Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enhances security by requiring:
    a) A very long and complex password.
    b) Frequent password changes.
    c) Two or more different types of verification factors (e.g., something you know, something you have, something you are).
    d) Biometric authentication only.

8.  Security governance primarily involves:
    a) Implementing specific technical security controls.
    b) Responding to security incidents.
    c) Establishing and maintaining the framework (policies, standards, roles) to manage security and risk.
    d) Conducting penetration testing.

**Part 2: Short Answer (Provide concise, well-reasoned answers)**

9.  Explain the difference between a security vulnerability and a security threat.
10. What is the main purpose of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)? How does it differ from an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)?
11. Describe the purpose of cryptographic hashing. List one common use case.
12. What is a security policy, and why is it important for an organization?
13. Explain the principle of "least privilege" in access control.
14. What is the primary goal of penetration testing?

**Part 3: Scenario Analysis & Application (Provide detailed responses)**

15. **Scenario:** An employee reports receiving a suspicious email asking them to click a link and verify their login credentials for a company system. Based on Module 3.1.CY/3.3.CY, what type of attack is this likely to be? Describe the immediate steps the employee and the IT/Security team should take.

16. **Scenario:** A small business owner wants to improve the basic security of their office network. Based on Module 3.2.CY, recommend three fundamental network security controls they should implement and briefly explain the purpose of each.

17. **Scenario:** An organization is developing its incident response plan (Module 3.3.CY). Describe the key activities that should occur during the "Preparation" phase to ensure the organization is ready to handle security incidents effectively.
