## Section 1: Advanced Digital Marketing Strategy (Based on Module 4.1.OMS)

**Scenario 1 (Questions 1-5):**
A rapidly growing B2B SaaS company, "InnovateHub," specializing in project management software, has successfully captured the SMB market using basic digital marketing tactics (keyword-focused SEO, standard Google Ads, regular blogging, basic social media presence). They now aim to target larger enterprise clients (500+ employees) and significantly increase their market share against established competitors over the next two years. Their current marketing analytics primarily rely on last-click attribution.

1.  **Technical SEO Audit:** Outline the key steps and advanced technical SEO areas you would prioritize in an audit for InnovateHub to improve their visibility and authority for enterprise-level search queries. Explain *why* these specific areas (e.g., log file analysis, schema for SaaS, site speed for complex platforms) are critical for targeting enterprise clients.
2.  **PPC Strategy Evolution:** Design a sophisticated PPC strategy for InnovateHub to reach enterprise decision-makers. Detail the advanced bidding strategies, complex audience targeting methods (including Customer Match and Combined Audiences), and campaign types (beyond standard Search) you would employ. Justify your choices based on the target audience and goals.
3.  **Content Ecosystem for Enterprise:** Describe how you would evolve InnovateHub's content strategy from simple blogging to a comprehensive content ecosystem designed to attract, engage, and convert enterprise leads. Include specific examples of pillar pages, cluster content, advanced content formats (e.g., interactive ROI calculators, in-depth white papers), and personalization tactics.
4.  **Attribution Modeling Shift:** Explain why InnovateHub's current last-click attribution model is inadequate for their new strategic goals. Recommend a more appropriate attribution model (or models) and justify your choice. Describe how implementing this new model would change their understanding of channel performance and impact budget allocation decisions.
5.  **Emerging Trend Integration:** Select two emerging digital marketing trends (e.g., AI in personalization, voice search optimization for B2B queries, advanced programmatic advertising) and explain how InnovateHub could strategically leverage them to gain a competitive advantage in the enterprise software market.

**Scenario 2 (Questions 6-8):**
A direct-to-consumer (DTC) sustainable fashion brand, "Evergreen Style," relies heavily on social media marketing, particularly Instagram and Pinterest. They want to scale their paid social advertising significantly while maintaining brand authenticity and maximizing ROI. They are also concerned about accurately measuring the impact of their influencer marketing collaborations.

6.  **Scaling Paid Social:** Outline a strategy for Evergreen Style to scale their paid social advertising effectively across multiple platforms. Detail the advanced targeting, A/B testing methodologies, and budget allocation strategies you would recommend. How would you ensure the campaigns remain aligned with their brand values?
7.  **Influencer Marketing ROI & Ethics:** Describe a robust framework for Evergreen Style to select, manage, and measure the ROI of their influencer marketing campaigns. Address how to move beyond vanity metrics and ensure ethical compliance (e.g., disclosures).
8.  **Social Listening for Strategy:** Explain how Evergreen Style could use advanced social listening tools and techniques to gain strategic insights beyond basic brand mentions. Provide examples of how this data could inform product development, content strategy, and competitive positioning.

**Short Answer Questions (Questions 9-12):**

9.  Explain the concept of E-A-T (Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) in SEO and why it is particularly crucial for certain types of websites. Provide three concrete examples of how a financial services website could improve its E-A-T signals.

**Scenario 3 (Questions 13-18):**
"TechSolutions Inc.," a provider of integrated hardware and software solutions, is experiencing rapid growth but facing challenges: inconsistent sales performance across regions, difficulty in accurately forecasting revenue, high salesperson turnover attributed partly to the compensation plan, and struggles managing its largest, most complex global accounts.

13. **Sales Forecasting Improvement:** TechSolutions currently uses a simple Sales Force Composite method for forecasting. Recommend two additional forecasting techniques (one qualitative, one quantitative) they should implement to improve accuracy. Explain the pros and cons of each and how they would complement the existing method.
14. **Territory Management Redesign:** The current sales territories are based purely on geography, leading to significant workload and potential imbalances. Outline a process for redesigning the territories using a hybrid approach that considers both market potential and workload. What data would be essential for this redesign?

Include different elements (base, commission, bonus) and justify their structure.

Go beyond simple quota tracking and include aspects like coaching frameworks, KPI dashboards (leading and lagging indicators), and performance improvement plans.

"Global Health Tech" (GHT) provides telehealth platforms and remote patient monitoring solutions. They operate globally with distinct sales and marketing teams for different regions and customer segments (hospitals, private clinics, insurance providers).
