# Level 3 Exam: Computer Science (CS)

**Instructions:** Answer all questions thoroughly. This exam assesses your integrated understanding of data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming, database fundamentals, and software development principles covered in Modules 3.1.CS, 3.2.CS, and 3.3.CS.

**Part 1: Multiple Choice (Select the best answer)**

1.  Which data structure operates on a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle?
    a) Queue
    b) Stack
    c) Linked List
    d) Tree

2.  What is the typical time complexity of searching for an element in a balanced Binary Search Tree (BST)?
    a) O(1)
    b) O(log n)
    c) O(n)
    d) O(n^2)

3.  Which sorting algorithm generally has the worst-case time complexity of O(n^2) but an average-case complexity of O(n log n)?
    a) Bubble Sort
    b) Merge Sort
    c) Quick Sort
    d) Insertion Sort

4.  Encapsulation, a core principle of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), primarily involves:
    a) Allowing objects of different classes to respond to the same message.
    b) Bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit (class).
    c) Creating new classes based on existing classes, inheriting properties and methods.
    d) Hiding the internal implementation details of an object from the outside world.

5.  Inheritance in OOP allows a class (subclass) to:
    a) Access private members of its superclass directly.
    b) Inherit attributes and methods from another class (superclass).
    c) Contain multiple objects of the same type.
    d) Define methods with the same name but different parameters (overloading).

6.  In relational databases, what is used to uniquely identify each record in a table?
    a) Foreign Key
    b) Primary Key
    c) Index
    d) Schema

7.  Which SQL command is used to retrieve data from a database table?
    a) INSERT
    b) UPDATE
    c) DELETE
    d) SELECT

8.  The Waterfall model in software development is characterized by:
    a) Iterative development cycles with frequent feedback.
    b) A sequential, linear progression through distinct phases (requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment).
    c) Flexibility to accommodate changing requirements throughout the process.
    d) Close collaboration between development and operations teams (DevOps).

**Part 2: Short Answer (Provide concise, well-reasoned answers)**

9.  Explain the difference between an Array and a Linked List in terms of memory allocation and insertion/deletion efficiency.
10. What is the purpose of using Big O notation in algorithm analysis?
11. Define Polymorphism in the context of Object-Oriented Programming.
12. What is database normalization, and why is it important?
13. Briefly describe the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases.
14. Explain the concept of version control (e.g., using Git) in software development and list one benefit.

**Part 3: Scenario Analysis & Application (Provide detailed responses)**

15. **Scenario:** You need to store a collection of items where the order of insertion matters, and you frequently need to add items to one end and remove items from the *other* end. Based on Module 3.1.CS, which data structure (Stack or Queue) would be more appropriate and why? Describe the key operations for that structure.

16. **Scenario:** A developer needs to write a function to search for a specific book title within a large, unsorted list of books. Based on Module 3.2.CS, what would be the time complexity of a simple linear search? If the list were sorted, what more efficient search algorithm could be used, and what would its time complexity be?

17. **Scenario:** You are designing a simple software system to manage library books and members. Using Object-Oriented principles (Module 3.3.CS), identify two potential classes you might create. For one of those classes, list two possible attributes (data) and two possible methods (actions).
