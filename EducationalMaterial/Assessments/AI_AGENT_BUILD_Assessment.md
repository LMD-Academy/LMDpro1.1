# Assessment: Building Autonomous AI Agentic Systems

**Instructions:** This assessment evaluates your understanding of the principles, architectures, and practical implementation techniques for building sophisticated autonomous AI agents, as covered in the "Building Autonomous AI Agentic Systems" course.

---

## Section 1: Core Concepts (40 Points)

1.  **Define an Autonomous AI Agent:** Differentiate it from traditional automation scripts and explain the significance of "proactive execution." (10 points)
2.  **Architectural Pillars:** Describe the five core architectural pillars of an agentic system (LLM Brain, Perception, Planning, Action, Memory) and explain how they interact within an agent loop. (15 points)
3.  **Role of LLMs:** Discuss the central role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in agent orchestration, reasoning, and dynamic tool selection. (10 points)
4.  **MLLMs in Perception:** Explain the importance of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for an agent's visual perception, especially in GUI automation. What are some challenges? (5 points)

## Section 2: Design and Implementation (40 Points)

5.  **Tool Abstraction:** Why is a tool abstraction layer crucial for an agent? Describe two key principles for designing effective tool abstractions. (10 points)
6.  **Planning Strategies:** Compare and contrast Chain of Thought (CoT) and ReAct (Reason+Act) as planning strategies for LLM-driven agents. When might you choose one over the other? (10 points)
7.  **Memory Systems:** Differentiate between short-term/working memory and long-term memory in an agent. Describe one technique for implementing long-term memory (e.g., using vector databases for RAG). (10 points)
8.  **GUI Automation Challenges:** What are two primary challenges in enabling agents to reliably automate GUIs? How can MLLMs help address these? (10 points)

## Section 3: Evaluation and Future Considerations (20 Points)

9.  **Agent Evaluation:** Propose three key metrics for evaluating the performance of an autonomous agent designed to automate customer support inquiries via a web interface. Justify your choices. (10 points)
10. **Safety and Ethics:** Identify two potential safety risks and one ethical consideration when deploying an autonomous agent capable of executing shell commands and accessing web APIs. Suggest a mitigation strategy for one of the identified risks. (10 points)
