## Section 2: Executive Decision Making & Change Leadership (Based on Module 4.2.GM)

**Scenario 3 (Questions 14-19):**
"RetailRevamp Inc.," a large brick-and-mortar retail chain, is undertaking a major digital transformation initiative to integrate its online and physical stores, personalize customer experiences, and optimize its supply chain using data analytics. The initiative involves significant investment, process changes, and impacts nearly every department. There is considerable resistance from long-tenured store managers and skepticism from middle management about the feasibility and benefits.

14. **Decision-Making Models:** Compare and contrast the Rational Decision-Making Model with Bounded Rationality and the Garbage Can Model. Which model (or combination) best describes the likely decision-making reality during RetailRevamp's complex transformation? How can leaders improve decision quality in this context?
15. **Cognitive Biases:** Identify three specific cognitive biases (e.g., confirmation bias, anchoring, status quo bias) likely to affect decision-making regarding the digital transformation at RetailRevamp. For each bias, explain how it might manifest and suggest mitigation strategies for the leadership team.
16. **Change Management Framework:** Select a recognized change management model (e.g., Kotter's 8-Step Process, Lewin's 3-Stage Model, ADKAR). Outline how RetailRevamp's leadership should apply this model to effectively manage the digital transformation, specifically addressing the resistance from store managers and skepticism from middle management.
17. **Stakeholder Analysis & Communication:** Conduct a brief stakeholder analysis for this transformation initiative (identifying key internal and external stakeholders). Develop a communication strategy outlining key messages, channels, and frequency to engage different stakeholder groups and build buy-in.
18. **Leading Through Resistance:** Describe specific leadership actions the CEO and senior executives should take to address resistance constructively. How can they empower change champions and create a sense of urgency and shared vision?
19. **Measuring Change Success:** Beyond the technical implementation, how should RetailRevamp measure the success of this change initiative? Define key metrics related to adoption, behavioral change, and ultimate business impact.

**Scenario 4 (Questions 20-22):**
A fast-growing technology company, "InnovateFast," prides itself on its agile culture but is experiencing growing pains. Decision-making has become slower as the company has grown, communication between departments is strained, and there's a lack of clarity on strategic priorities.

20. **Decision-Making Structures:** Analyze different decision-making structures (e.g., centralized, decentralized, consensus-based). What structure or approach would be most appropriate for InnovateFast to maintain agility while ensuring strategic alignment as it scales? Consider the use of frameworks like RACI or RAPID.
21. **Improving Cross-Functional Collaboration:** Recommend specific mechanisms or practices InnovateFast could implement to improve communication and collaboration between departments (e.g., cross-functional teams, shared goals/OKRs, regular inter-departmental forums).
22. **Ethical Decision-Making Framework:** Describe a framework InnovateFast's leadership could use to ensure ethical considerations are consistently integrated into their rapid decision-making processes, especially when faced with competing priorities or ambiguous situations.

**Short Answer Questions (Questions 23-26):**

23. Explain the difference between programmed and non-programmed decisions and provide an example of each relevant to an executive level.
24. What is "psychological safety," and why is it crucial for effective team decision-making and successful change initiatives?
