## Section 1: Investment Management & Portfolio Theory (Based on Module 4.1.FA)

**Scenario 1 (Questions 1-6):**
You are an investment advisor managing a portfolio for a high-net-worth individual, Ms. Evelyn Reed, who is 55 years old, has a moderate risk tolerance, and a long-term investment horizon (15+ years). Her current portfolio is heavily concentrated in large-cap domestic stocks and cash.

1.  **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) Application:** Explain the core principles of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), including the concepts of diversification, efficient frontier, and the risk-return trade-off. How would you apply MPT to restructure Ms. Reed's portfolio to better align with her risk tolerance and objectives? Discuss the importance of correlation between asset classes.
2.  **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM):** Describe the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and its components (risk-free rate, beta, market risk premium). Explain how you would use CAPM to estimate the expected return for a potential stock investment for Ms. Reed's portfolio. What are the main limitations of CAPM in practice?
3.  **Asset Allocation Strategy:** Propose a strategic asset allocation for Ms. Reed's portfolio, considering her profile. Specify target percentages for major asset classes (e.g., domestic equity, international equity, fixed income, real estate, alternatives). Justify your allocation based on diversification principles and her risk/return objectives.
4.  **Behavioral Finance Considerations:** Identify two common behavioral biases (e.g., overconfidence, loss aversion, anchoring) that might affect Ms. Reed's investment decisions. How would you, as her advisor, recognize and help mitigate these biases?
5.  **Performance Evaluation:** Explain the purpose of the Sharpe Ratio and the Treynor Ratio in portfolio performance evaluation. When would you use one versus the other? How would you use these metrics to assess the performance of Ms. Reed's restructured portfolio against relevant benchmarks?
6.  **Alternative Investments:** Discuss the potential role of alternative investments (e.g., private equity, hedge funds, commodities) in Ms. Reed's portfolio. What are the potential benefits (diversification, return enhancement) and risks (illiquidity, complexity, fees) associated with these asset classes for an individual investor?

**Scenario 2 (Questions 7-9):**
A university endowment fund is considering incorporating Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors into its investment process.

7.  **ESG Integration Strategies:** Describe different approaches to ESG integration in investment management (e.g., negative screening, positive screening/best-in-class, thematic investing, impact investing). Recommend an approach (or combination) for the endowment fund and justify your choice.
8.  **ESG & Financial Performance:** Discuss the ongoing debate regarding the relationship between ESG factors and financial performance. What does current research suggest? What are the potential challenges in measuring the financial impact of ESG integration?
9.  **Fiduciary Duty & ESG:** How can the endowment's investment committee reconcile incorporating ESG factors with their fiduciary duty to maximize risk-adjusted returns for the university?

**Short Answer Questions (Questions 10-13):**

10. Differentiate between systematic risk (market risk) and unsystematic risk (specific risk). Which type of risk can be effectively reduced through diversification?
11. What is the Security Market Line (SML), and what does it represent graphically?
12. Explain the concept of "alpha" in investment management.
13. Briefly describe the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) and its three forms (weak, semi-strong, strong).

## Section 2: Advanced Corporate Finance & Capital Structure (Based on Module 4.2.FA)

**Scenario 3 (Questions 14-19):**
"GrowthTech Inc.," a publicly traded software company, is evaluating its capital structure. It currently has very little debt but significant cash reserves. The management team is considering taking on debt to fund a major acquisition and potentially repurchase shares. Analysts have noted the company might be underleveraged compared to its peers.

14. **Optimal Capital Structure Theories:** Discuss the key theories regarding optimal capital structure, including the Modigliani-Miller (M&M) propositions (with and without taxes), the Trade-Off Theory (balancing tax shields and financial distress costs), and the Pecking Order Theory. How do these theories help inform GrowthTech's decision?
15. **Cost of Capital (WACC):** Explain how taking on debt would likely impact GrowthTech's Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). Describe the components of WACC and how the cost of debt and cost of equity might change. Why is minimizing WACC generally considered a desirable goal?
16. **Debt vs. Equity Financing:** Analyze the advantages and disadvantages for GrowthTech of using debt versus equity to finance the acquisition. Consider factors like cost, risk (financial distress), flexibility, control (dilution), and signaling effects.
17. **Share Repurchases:** Evaluate the potential motivations and implications of GrowthTech using debt proceeds to repurchase shares. How might this impact earnings per share (EPS), return on equity (ROE), and shareholder value? What signals might a share repurchase send to the market?
18. **Agency Costs:** Explain the concepts of agency costs of equity (e.g., managers pursuing perks) and agency costs of debt (e.g., risk-shifting, underinvestment). How might changes in GrowthTech's capital structure affect these agency costs?
19. **Financial Flexibility:** Discuss the concept of financial flexibility. How does GrowthTech's current low-debt structure provide flexibility? How would taking on significant debt impact this flexibility, and why is it strategically important?

**Scenario 4 (Questions 20-22):**
"Stable Utility Co." operates in a regulated industry with predictable cash flows. They are considering different types of debt financing for a large infrastructure project.

20. **Debt Instruments:** Describe different types of long-term debt instruments Stable Utility Co. could consider (e.g., senior secured bonds, unsecured debentures, convertible debt). What factors would influence their choice?
21. **Credit Ratings:** Explain the role of credit rating agencies (e.g., Moody's, S&P) and the importance of maintaining a strong credit rating for a company like Stable Utility Co. How does the rating impact the cost of debt?
22. **Dividend Policy:** Given its stable cash flows, discuss the factors Stable Utility Co. should consider when setting its dividend policy. How does dividend policy relate to capital structure decisions?

**Short Answer Questions (Questions 23-26):**

23. What is financial leverage, and how is it typically measured?
24. Explain the concept of the "tax shield" provided by debt.
25. What are debt covenants, and what is their purpose?
26. Briefly describe asymmetric information and its relevance to capital structure decisions (e.g., Pecking Order Theory).

## Section 3: Integration & Synthesis (Based on Modules 4.1 & 4.2)

**Case Study (Questions 27-35):**
"Global Conglomerate Inc." (GCI) is a large, diversified multinational company with operations in several distinct industries (e.g., consumer goods, industrial manufacturing, technology services). The CFO is tasked with optimizing the company's overall financial strategy, including managing its investment portfolio of marketable securities, evaluating capital allocation across its diverse business units, and refining its corporate capital structure.

27. **Corporate vs. Business Unit Finance:** How should GCI's corporate finance strategy (Module 4.2) differ from the financial strategies pursued by its individual business units? Discuss the role of the corporate center in capital allocation and setting financial policies.
28. **Integrating Investment & Financing Decisions:** Explain the interconnectedness of GCI's investment decisions (which projects/businesses to fund) and its financing decisions (how to fund them). How should the WACC be used (or adjusted) when evaluating projects in different business units with varying risk profiles?
29. **Portfolio Management for Corporate Treasury:** How can the principles of investment management and portfolio theory (Module 4.1) be applied to GCI's management of its corporate cash reserves and short-term/medium-term investments? What are the primary objectives (liquidity, safety, yield)?
30. **Capital Structure across Divisions:** Should GCI aim for a single target capital structure across the entire conglomerate, or should it allow for different capital structures in its various business units based on their industry norms, risk profiles, and cash flow characteristics? Justify your reasoning.
31. **Risk Management Integration:** How can GCI integrate market risk management (from its investment portfolio) with the financial risks associated with its capital structure (e.g., interest rate risk on debt, leverage risk)?
32. **Valuation Implications:** How do GCI's capital structure decisions and its cost of capital impact the overall valuation of the conglomerate and its individual business units?
33. **Behavioral Finance at Corporate Level:** Can behavioral biases affect corporate-level capital structure and investment decisions (e.g., empire building, managerial overconfidence)? How can corporate governance mechanisms help mitigate these biases at GCI?
34. **Communicating Financial Strategy:** How should the CFO communicate GCI's integrated financial strategy (investment approach, capital structure policy, dividend policy) to the investment community (analysts, institutional investors)?
35. **CFO's Strategic Role:** Beyond traditional finance functions, what is the strategic role of GCI's CFO in integrating investment management, capital structure optimization, and capital allocation to drive overall corporate value creation?
