**Scenario 3 (Questions 14-19):**
"MediCare Systems," a large healthcare provider, is merging with a smaller regional hospital network.

The HR department is tasked with playing a key role in managing the integration process and fostering a unified organizational culture.

14. **Organizational Development (OD) Interventions:** Identify and describe three specific Organizational Development (OD) interventions that the HR team could use to facilitate the integration of the two organizations (e.g., team building for merged departments, culture assessment and integration workshops, process consultation for harmonizing workflows).

What steps should HR lead to assess the existing cultures, define a desired future culture, and manage the transition? How can leadership behaviors be leveraged to shape the new culture?
16. **Change Management Model Application:** Apply a specific change management model (e.g., Kotter, Lewin, ADKAR) to the merger integration process from an HR perspective. Detail the key actions HR should take at each stage, focusing on communication, employee engagement, and managing resistance.

**Scenario 4 (Questions 20-22):**
A financial services firm, "FinSecure," wants to implement a new performance management system focused on continuous feedback, coaching, and development, moving away from traditional annual appraisals. This represents a significant shift for both managers and employees.

20. **Managing Resistance to New PM System:** Anticipating resistance from managers accustomed to the old system and employees potentially wary of continuous feedback, what change management tactics should HR employ to ensure smooth adoption and buy-in?
21. **Training & Capability Building:** What training and support should be provided to managers and employees to equip them with the skills needed for effective continuous feedback, coaching conversations, and goal setting within the new system?
22. **Linking Performance Management to OD:** How does this shift in performance management philosophy connect to broader Organizational Development goals, such as fostering a learning culture, improving employee engagement, and developing leadership capabilities?
