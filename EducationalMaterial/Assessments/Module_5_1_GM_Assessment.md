**Instructions:** Answer the following questions thoroughly, demonstrating your ability to synthesize complex strategic concepts, apply executive judgment, and articulate strategic rationale relevant to C-suite leadership in a global context.

1.  **Global Strategic Challenges:**
    Imagine you are the CEO of a multinational corporation in the consumer electronics industry. Identify and analyze the top three global strategic challenges (e.g., geopolitical, technological, economic, social) your company is likely to face in the next five years. For each challenge, propose a high-level strategic response.

2.  **Corporate Portfolio Restructuring:**
    Your company, a diversified conglomerate, has a portfolio with some high-growth, high-potential businesses ("Stars"), some mature, cash-generating businesses ("Cash Cows"), and some underperforming businesses in declining markets ("Dogs"). Outline your strategic approach to managing this portfolio. How would you decide which businesses to invest in, harvest, or divest? What criteria would guide these decisions?

3.  **Leading a Major Organizational Transformation:**
    You need to lead a significant digital transformation across your entire global organization to enhance customer experience and operational efficiency. Describe your leadership approach. How would you build a guiding coalition, communicate the vision, manage resistance, and ensure the transformation is embedded in the company culture?

4.  **Stakeholder Management in a Crisis:**
    Your company faces a major reputational crisis due to a data breach in one of its international subsidiaries. As CEO, describe your immediate priorities and actions. How would you manage communication and engagement with key stakeholders (Board, investors, customers, regulators, employees, media) during this crisis?

5.  **Building a High-Performing C-Suite Team:**
    Discuss your philosophy and approach to building and leading your executive (C-suite) team. What qualities would you look for in your direct reports? How would you foster collaboration, manage potential conflicts, and ensure the team is aligned and effective in driving the corporate strategy?

6.  **Ethical Leadership and Corporate Governance:**
    Describe a complex ethical dilemma a C-suite leader might face when making a strategic decision with global implications (e.g., sourcing from countries with different labor standards, market entry into a politically sensitive region). How would you approach this decision, considering both business objectives and ethical responsibilities? What role does the Board of Directors play in ensuring ethical conduct and good governance?
