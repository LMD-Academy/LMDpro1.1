The company's required rate of return (WACC) is 10%. Calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) of this project and state whether the company should accept or reject it based on the NPV rule. (Show your calculations or explain the steps clearly. PV factors for 10%: Yr1=0.909, Yr2=0.826, Yr3=0.751, Yr4=0.683, Yr5=0.621).
