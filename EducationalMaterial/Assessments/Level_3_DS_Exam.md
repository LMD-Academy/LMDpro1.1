    b) Matplotlib
    c) Scikit-learn
    d) NumPy

3.  The Pandas DataFrame is best described as:
    a) A one-dimensional labeled array.
    b) A two-dimensional, size-mutable, tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns).
    c) A library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
    d) A tool for building machine learning models.

4.  Which data visualization technique is most suitable for showing the distribution of a single numerical variable?
    a) Scatter Plot

    a) Mean
    b) Median
    c) Mode
    d) Standard Deviation

6.  Hypothesis testing primarily aims to:
    a) Prove a theory with absolute certainty.
    b) Determine if there is enough statistical evidence to reject a null hypothesis.
    c) Describe the central tendency of a dataset.
    d) Visualize data distributions.

7.  Which type of machine learning involves training a model on labeled data (input-output pairs)?
    a) Supervised Learning
    b) Unsupervised Learning
    c) Reinforcement Learning
    d) Semi-supervised Learning

8.  Classification, in the context of machine learning, is a task that involves:
    a) Predicting a continuous numerical value.
    b) Grouping similar data points together without predefined labels.
    c) Assigning data points to predefined categories or classes.
    d) Learning through trial and error based on rewards.

**Part 2: Short Answer (Provide concise, well-reasoned answers)**

9.  Describe the difference between structured and unstructured data, providing an example of each.
10. What is the purpose of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)? List two common EDA techniques.
11. Explain the concept of correlation between two variables. Does correlation imply causation?
12. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning?
13. Briefly describe the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.
14. What is "overfitting" in machine learning, and why is it a problem?

**Part 3: Scenario Analysis & Application (Provide detailed responses)**

15. **Scenario:** You are given a dataset containing customer purchase history (customer ID, product purchased, date, price). Describe how you would use Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib (Module 3.1.DS & 3.2.DS) to perform initial data exploration. What are two specific insights you might try to uncover (e.g., most popular products, purchase frequency)?

16. **Scenario:** A marketing team wants to understand if a recent advertising campaign led to a statistically significant increase in website traffic. Describe the basic steps involved in setting up a hypothesis test (Module 3.2.DS) to investigate this. What would the null and alternative hypotheses be?

17. **Scenario:** An e-commerce company wants to build a system to recommend products to users based on their past behavior and the behavior of similar users. Based on Module 3.3.DS, identify whether this is primarily a supervised or unsupervised learning problem. Briefly describe one type of machine learning algorithm (e.g., clustering, classification, regression - choose the most relevant) that could be applied to this problem and explain its basic function in this context.
