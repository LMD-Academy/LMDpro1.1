# Module Assessment: Scaling Agile & Lean Portfolio Management (Module 4.1.AB)

**Instructions:** Answer all questions thoroughly. This assessment evaluates your understanding of the challenges in scaling Agile, the major scaling frameworks, Lean Portfolio Management principles, and strategies for aligning strategy with execution.

---

**Question 1: Framework Comparison and Recommendation (25 points)**

A rapidly growing e-commerce company with 10 Agile teams (around 80 people in product development) is struggling with cross-team dependencies, aligning product roadmaps with strategic business goals, and ensuring timely delivery of large, cross-cutting features. They are looking to adopt a scaled Agile framework.

*   a) Briefly describe the core tenets of **SAFe** and **LeSS**.
*   b) Compare and contrast how SAFe and LeSS approach **portfolio management**, **dependency management**, and the **role of management**.
*   c) Recommend either SAFe or LeSS (or elements of both) for this e-commerce company. Justify your recommendation based on their size, context, and stated challenges.

**Question 2: Lean Portfolio Management Implementation (25 points)**

Imagine you are an Agile coach tasked with helping a traditional manufacturing company implement Lean Portfolio Management (LPM). Their current process involves annual budgeting cycles, project-based funding, and a large PMO focused on detailed project plans.

*   a) Explain the three core functions of LPM (e.g., Strategy & Investment Funding, Agile Portfolio Operations, Lean Governance).
*   b) Describe the key steps you would take to introduce and implement a **Portfolio Kanban** system. What benefits would this bring?
*   c) How would you advocate for shifting from project-based funding to **funding value streams**? What challenges do you anticipate, and how would you address them?

**Question 3: Agile Release Trains and PI Planning (20 points)**

*   a) Explain the concept of an **Agile Release Train (ART)** in SAFe. What is its purpose, typical composition, and duration of its planning cycle (Program Increment - PI)?
*   b) Describe the key inputs, activities, and outputs of a **PI Planning event**. How does this event address challenges of alignment, coordination, and dependency management for an ART?

**Question 4: Value Streams and Flow Metrics (15 points)**

*   a) Define a **Value Stream** in an Agile context. Why is identifying and organizing around value streams important for scaling Agile?
*   b) Select three **flow metrics** (e.g., Flow Time, Flow Velocity, WIP, Flow Efficiency) and explain how they can be used to monitor and improve the performance of a scaled Agile system (like an ART or a set of teams working on a value stream).

**Question 5: Challenges and Key Roles in Scaling (15 points)**

*   a) Discuss two significant **challenges** organizations often face when attempting to scale Agile beyond a few teams.
*   b) Briefly describe the role and importance of the **Release Train Engineer (RTE)** in SAFe and the **Product Owner** in a scaled context like LeSS (where one PO might serve multiple teams).
