## Section 1: Scaling Agile Frameworks & Value Streams (Based on Module 4.1.AB)

**Scenario 1 (Questions 1-6):**
"FinTech Innovators," a financial technology company with around 500 employees, has successfully implemented Scrum within individual product development teams (approx. 15 teams). They are now experiencing challenges coordinating work across teams, managing dependencies, aligning team efforts with strategic business objectives, and delivering larger features that require collaboration. They are considering adopting a scaled Agile framework.

1.  **Framework Selection:** Analyze two prominent scaled Agile frameworks (e.g., SAFe, LeSS, Nexus, Scrum@Scale). Compare and contrast their core principles, structures, and suitability for FinTech Innovators. Recommend one framework (or a hybrid approach) and justify your choice based on their context (size, industry, coordination challenges).
2.  **Value Stream Identification:** Explain the concept of Value Streams in an Agile context. Outline the process FinTech Innovators should undertake to identify their key development value streams (from concept to cash). Why is organizing around value streams often more effective than organizing around projects or functional silos?
3.  **Agile Release Train (ART) / Equivalent Structure:** Assuming they adopt SAFe (or describe the equivalent multi-team structure in your recommended framework), explain the purpose and key roles within an Agile Release Train (ART) or equivalent structure. How would FinTech Innovators launch their first ART(s)? What teams would likely be included?
4.  **Program Increment (PI) Planning / Equivalent:** Describe the purpose and key activities of a Program Increment (PI) Planning event (or the equivalent multi-team planning event in your chosen framework). How does this event help address FinTech Innovators' challenges with cross-team coordination, dependency management, and alignment with business objectives?
5.  **Lean Portfolio Management (LPM):** Explain how implementing Lean Portfolio Management (LPM) principles would help FinTech Innovators align strategy with execution. Discuss key LPM concepts like strategic themes, portfolio Kanban, Lean budgets, and participatory budgeting.
6.  **Measuring Flow:** Traditional project metrics (e.g., on-time, on-budget) may not be sufficient. Recommend key flow metrics (e.g., Flow Velocity, Flow Time, Flow Load, Flow Efficiency, Flow Distribution) that FinTech Innovators should track at the program/portfolio level to understand and improve their value delivery capability.

**Scenario 2 (Questions 7-9):**
A large insurance company, "SecureInsure," is attempting to apply Agile principles to its claims processing value stream, which involves multiple departments (customer service, claims assessment, fraud detection, payment processing) and legacy systems.

7.  **Applying Agile Beyond Software:** Discuss the challenges and opportunities of applying Agile principles and practices (like Kanban, iterative improvements, feedback loops) to a non-software process like claims processing at SecureInsure.
8.  **Value Stream Mapping:** Describe how Value Stream Mapping could be used to analyze the current claims processing workflow at SecureInsure. What insights would this exercise likely reveal regarding bottlenecks, handoffs, and delays?
9.  **Cross-Functional Teams in Operations:** How could SecureInsure structure cross-functional teams around the claims processing value stream to improve flow and reduce handoffs, even with existing departmental structures?

**Short Answer Questions (Questions 10-13):**

10. What is the core purpose of scaling Agile frameworks?
11. Define "feature" and "epic" in the context of scaled Agile.
12. Explain the concept of "Inspect and Adapt" (I&A) at the program or portfolio level.
13. What is WIP (Work in Progress) limit, and why is it crucial for managing flow in Agile systems (especially Kanban)?

## Section 2: Agile Leadership & Organizational Change (Based on Module 4.2.AB)

**Scenario 3 (Questions 14-19):**
"Retail Giant Corp" is embarking on an enterprise-wide Agile transformation, aiming to improve time-to-market, customer responsiveness, and employee engagement. The initiative faces significant hurdles: a deeply ingrained hierarchical culture, middle managers fearing loss of control, resistance from functional silos, and inconsistent executive sponsorship.

14. **Agile Leadership Mindset:** Contrast the traditional management mindset with the Agile leadership mindset (e.g., leader-leader vs. leader-follower, enabling vs. directing, embracing uncertainty vs. seeking predictability). Why is this mindset shift critical for the success of Retail Giant Corp's transformation?
15. **Role of Middle Management:** Middle managers often feel threatened by Agile transformations. Describe a constructive role for middle managers in an Agile organization. How can leaders coach and support them through this transition, transforming them into Agile leaders?
16. **Breaking Down Silos:** Functional silos are hindering collaboration. Propose specific organizational design changes and operating model adjustments (beyond just co-locating teams) that Retail Giant Corp could implement to foster cross-functional collaboration and a value-stream focus.
17. **Addressing Resistance:** Apply a change management framework (e.g., Kotter, ADKAR) specifically to address the resistance from middle managers and functional silos at Retail Giant Corp. What targeted interventions and communication strategies are needed?
18. **Building Psychological Safety:** Explain the concept of psychological safety and why it is foundational for Agile teams and transformations. What specific actions can leaders at Retail Giant Corp take to cultivate psychological safety within teams and across the organization?
19. **Sustaining Change:** Agile transformations are often difficult to sustain. What strategies should Retail Giant Corp's leadership put in place to embed Agile ways of working into the organizational culture and ensure the changes stick long-term (e.g., aligning incentives, continuous coaching, communities of practice)?

**Scenario 4 (Questions 20-22):**
A software company, "AgileSoft," has successfully adopted Scrum at the team level but struggles with alignment between teams and overall product strategy. Product Owners feel disconnected from the bigger picture, and executives complain they lack visibility into progress against strategic goals.

20. **Connecting Strategy to Teams:** Describe mechanisms AgileSoft could implement to improve the connection between high-level strategy (e.g., company OKRs, strategic themes) and the work being done by individual Scrum teams (e.g., Product Roadmaps, PI Objectives, backlog refinement with strategic context).
21. **Role of Agile Leaders in Alignment:** What is the specific role of Agile leaders (e.g., Scrum Masters, Release Train Engineers, Agile Coaches, Executives) in facilitating this strategic alignment across multiple teams?
22. **Servant Leadership in Practice:** Explain the concept of Servant Leadership. Provide three concrete examples of how a manager at AgileSoft could practice servant leadership to better support their Agile teams.

**Short Answer Questions (Questions 23-26):**

23. List three key differences between managing projects and leading Agile transformations.
24. What is a Community of Practice (CoP) in an Agile context, and what purpose does it serve?
25. Explain the importance of "invitation over imposition" in Agile change initiatives.
26. Define "Gemba" or "Go See" and its relevance for Agile leaders.

## Section 3: Integration & Synthesis (Based on Modules 4.1 & 4.2)

**Case Study (Questions 27-35):**
"HealthForward," a large healthcare organization encompassing hospitals, clinics, and insurance services, is launching a major initiative to improve the end-to-end patient journey through digital transformation and process redesign. They aim to leverage Agile principles across clinical, administrative, and IT functions involved in patient care pathways (e.g., scheduling, admission, treatment coordination, billing, follow-up). This requires significant coordination across diverse professional groups (doctors, nurses, administrators, IT specialists) and overcoming traditional departmental boundaries and regulatory constraints.

27. **Integrating Scaling Frameworks & Change Leadership:** How must HealthForward integrate the technical aspects of scaling Agile practices (Module 4.1 - e.g., identifying patient journey value streams, implementing cross-functional teams, using Kanban for workflow visibility) with the principles of Agile leadership and organizational change (Module 4.2 - e.g., mindset shifts, addressing resistance, building psychological safety)?
28. **Value Stream for Patient Journey:** Outline how HealthForward could identify and map a key patient journey (e.g., elective surgery) as a value stream. Who should be involved in this mapping? What kind of teams could be formed around this value stream?
29. **Leadership Mindset in Healthcare:** What specific challenges exist in fostering an Agile leadership mindset within a traditional healthcare setting? How can leaders balance the need for agility and experimentation with the critical requirements for patient safety, compliance, and clinical protocols?
30. **Applying Lean-Agile Principles:** Identify three Lean-Agile principles (e.g., visualize work, limit WIP, optimize flow, build quality in, respect for people) and explain how they could be specifically applied to improve the patient journey value stream at HealthForward.
31. **Change Management for Clinicians:** Clinicians (doctors, nurses) are critical stakeholders. Design a change management approach specifically tailored to engage clinicians, address their concerns (e.g., impact on autonomy, administrative burden), and gain their buy-in for the new ways of working.
