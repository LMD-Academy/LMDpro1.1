# Sub-Course: Python_Fundamentals_Recap_and_NumPy

This content is a placeholder for the sub-course on **Python Fundamentals Recap & NumPy**. This module is part of the "Python_for_Data_Science" standalone course within the "Technology_Development" field.

**Overview from Course Structure:** Core Python concepts essential for data science. Introduction to NumPy for numerical computation.
**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**Length:** 5 hours

**Learning Objectives (Illustrative):**
*   Review and solidify understanding of core Python programming concepts.
*   Understand the importance of NumPy for numerical computing in Python.
*   Learn to create and manipulate NumPy ndarrays (N-dimensional arrays).
*   Perform basic mathematical and statistical operations on NumPy arrays.
*   Understand array indexing, slicing, and broadcasting.

**Key Topics to be Covered (Illustrative):**
*   **Python Fundamentals Review:**
    *   Data types (integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets).
    *   Variables and assignment.
    *   Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical).
    *   Control flow (if/else statements, for/while loops).
    *   Functions (definition, parameters, return values).
    *   Basic input/output.
*   **Introduction to NumPy:**
    *   Why NumPy? (Performance, convenience for numerical tasks).
    *   The NumPy ndarray object.
*   **Array Creation:**
    *   From Python lists.
    *   Using `np.array()`, `np.zeros()`, `np.ones()`, `np.arange()`, `np.linspace()`.
*   **Array Attributes:** `shape`, `ndim`, `size`, `dtype`.
*   **Array Indexing and Slicing:**
    *   Accessing single elements and subarrays.
    *   Boolean indexing.
*   **Array Operations:**
    *   Element-wise arithmetic operations.
    *   Universal functions (ufuncs) like `np.sqrt()`, `np.exp()`, `np.sin()`.
    *   Aggregate functions (`np.sum()`, `np.mean()`, `np.std()`, `np.min()`, `np.max()`).
*   **Broadcasting:** How NumPy treats arrays with different shapes during arithmetic operations.
*   Basic linear algebra operations (e.g., dot product).
