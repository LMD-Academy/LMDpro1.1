# Module 4.1.DS: Advanced Machine Learning & AI

**Level:** 4 (Senior / Extremely Advanced)
**Major:** Data Science (DS)

**Estimated Content Length:** 18-25+ A4 Pages

**Prerequisites:** Module 3.1.DS (Data Science Fundamentals & Python Programming), Module 3.2.DS (Data Analysis & Visualization), Module 3.3.DS (Introduction to Machine Learning)

**Learning Objectives:**
*   Master advanced supervised learning techniques including ensemble methods (Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines like XGBoost/LightGBM/CatBoost), and Support Vector Machines (SVMs).
*   Implement and evaluate advanced unsupervised learning methods such as DBSCAN, hierarchical clustering, and advanced dimensionality reduction techniques (t-SNE, UMAP).
*   Understand the fundamentals of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Deep Learning, including common architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image data and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)/LSTMs/GRUs for sequential data.
*   Gain practical experience with deep learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow with Keras, or PyTorch - conceptual overview and one practical focus).
*   Explore foundational Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques: text representation (Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, Word Embeddings like Word2Vec/GloVe), sentiment analysis, and topic modeling (e.g., LDA).
*   Get introduced to the core concepts of Reinforcement Learning (agents, environments, rewards, policies).
*   Analyze and mitigate
