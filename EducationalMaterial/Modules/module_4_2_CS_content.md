## 1. Introduction: Computing Beyond a Single Machine
    *   Limitations of single-machine systems for modern applications (scalability, availability, fault tolerance).
    *   Defining Distributed Systems: A collection of independent computers that appear to its users as a single coherent system.
    *   Defining Cloud Computing: A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources.
    *   Importance of these concepts in contemporary software engineering, data processing, and IT infrastructure.
    *   Overview of the module: principles of distributed systems, cloud models, key technologies.

## 2. Fundamental Principles of Distributed Systems
    *   **Characteristics:**
        *   Concurrency of components.
        *   Lack of a global clock.
        *   Independent failures of components.
        *   Resource sharing.
        *   Openness and heterogeneity.
        *   Scalability (vertical vs. horizontal).
    *   **Goals/Benefits:**
        *   Increased performance/throughput (parallelism).
        *   Improved availability and reliability (fault tolerance via redundancy).
        *   Scalability (handling growing load).
        *   Geographical distribution.
        *   Resource sharing.
    *   **Challenges (The "Fallacies of Distributed Computing" - Peter Deutsch):**
        1.  The network is reliable. (False)
        2.  Latency is zero. (False)
        3.  Bandwidth is infinite. (False)
        4.  The network is secure. (False)
        5.  Topology doesn't change. (False)
        6.  There is one administrator. (False)
        7.  Transport cost is zero. (False)
        8.  The network is homogeneous. (False)
    *   Transparency in Distributed Systems (Access, Location, Migration, Replication, Concurrency, Failure, Performance, Scaling).

## 3. Architectural Patterns for Distributed Systems
    *   **Client-Server Architecture:** (Two-tier, Three-tier, N-tier).
    *   **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture:** Decentralized, nodes act as both clients and servers.
    *   **Microservices Architecture:** Decomposing applications into small, independent, deployable services.
    *   **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):** (Precursor to microservices, often using web services).
    *   **Event-Driven Architecture:** Components communicate via asynchronous events/messages.
    *   **Layered Architectures.**

## 4. Key Concepts in Distributed Systems
    *   **Communication:**
        *   Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) and Remote Method Invocation (RMI).
        *   Message-Oriented Middleware (MOM) (e.g., message queues like RabbitMQ, Kafka).
        *   REST APIs and Web Services.
    *   **Concurrency Control & Synchronization:**
        *   Distributed locks, distributed transactions (Two-Phase Commit - 2PC - basics).
        *   Logical clocks (Lamport timestamps, Vector clocks) for ordering events.
    *   **Consistency Models:** Define the contract between a distributed data store and its clients regarding the visibility of updates.
        *   *Strong Consistency:* All clients see the same view of data at all times (e.g., linearizability, sequential consistency). Hard to achieve with high availability and partition tolerance.
        *   *Weak Consistency Models:*
            *   *Eventual Consistency:* If no new updates are made, eventually all accesses will return the last updated value. Common in highly available systems (e.g., DNS, some NoSQL databases).
            *   Causal consistency, Read-your-writes consistency, Monotonic reads/writes.
        *   *CAP Theorem (Brewer's Theorem):* A distributed system can only provide two of three guarantees: Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance. In practice, partition tolerance is usually a must, so systems often choose between C and A (CP vs. AP systems).
    *   **Fault Tolerance & Reliability:**
        *   Redundancy (data replication, service replication).
        *   Failure detection (heartbeats, timeouts).
        *   Recovery mechanisms.
    *   **Consensus Algorithms:** Ensure all nodes in a distributed system agree on a particular value or state, even in the presence of failures.
        *   *Paxos:* A family of protocols for reaching consensus.
        *   *Raft:* Designed to be more understandable than Paxos.
        *   Used in distributed databases, coordination services (like ZooKeeper, etcd). (Conceptual overview of their purpose and challenges).

## 5. Cloud Computing Fundamentals
    *   **Definition (NIST):** Characteristics (On-demand self-service, Broad network access, Resource pooling, Rapid elasticity, Measured service).
    *   **Service Models:**

        *   **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** Provides a platform for developing, running, and managing applications without managing the underlying infrastructure. (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Azure App Service, Google App Engine, Heroku).
        *   **Software as a Service (SaaS):** Provides ready-to-use software applications over the internet, on a subscription basis. (e.g., Gmail, Salesforce, Office 365, Dropbox).
        *   *(Conceptual Diagram: Layered pyramid showing IaaS at base, PaaS in middle, SaaS at top, with examples and level of user management.)*
    *   **Deployment Models:**

        *   **Key Concepts:**
            *   *Cluster:* A set of worker machines (nodes) that run containerized applications.
            *   *Control Plane (Master Nodes):* Manages the cluster state (API server, scheduler, controller manager, etcd).
            *   *Nodes (Worker Nodes):* Run application containers (kubelet, kube-proxy, container runtime).
            *   *Pods:* Smallest deployable units; one or more containers sharing storage/network.
            *   *Services:* Abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service.
            *   *Deployments:* Declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.
            *   *Namespaces:* Virtual clusters within a physical cluster.
        *   **Benefits:** Automated scaling, self-healing, service discovery, load balancing, rolling updates and rollbacks.

## 8. Distributed Data Management
    *   **Distributed Databases:**
        *   Data is partitioned and/or replicated across multiple physical locations.

        *   **Network Security:** Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), security groups/network security groups (NSGs), firewalls, WAFs, DDoS protection.
        *   **Data Encryption:** At rest and in transit. Key management services (KMS).
        *   **API Security:** Authentication, authorization, rate limiting for APIs between services.
