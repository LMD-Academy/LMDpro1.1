    *   Defining motivation and employee engagement.
    *   Why motivation and engagement are critical for individual and organizational success.

## 2. Understanding Key Motivation Theories
    *   **A. Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs:**
        *   Explanation of the five levels: Physiological, Safety, Social (Love/Belonging), Esteem, Self-Actualization.
        *   *(Conceptual Diagram: Maslow's pyramid.)*
        *   Implications for leaders in the workplace context.
    *   **B. Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory (Motivation-Hygiene Theory):**
        *   Hygiene Factors (Extrinsic - prevent dissatisfaction): e.g., salary, job security, working conditions.
        *   Motivators (Intrinsic - lead to satisfaction/motivation): e.g., achievement, recognition, work itself, responsibility, growth.
        *   Implications for job design and rewards.

        *   Three key relationships: Expectancy (Effort-Performance), Instrumentality (Performance-Outcome), Valence (Outcome-Personal Goal).
        *   Motivation = E * I * V (conceptual formula).
        *   *(Conceptual Diagram: Flowchart of Expectancy Theory.)*
        *   Implications for leaders: clarifying links, offering valued rewards.
    *   *(Briefly mention other theories like McGregor's Theory X/Y, McClelland's Acquired Needs as context if space allows.)*

## 3. Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation
    *   **A. Intrinsic Motivation:**
        *   Definition: Driven by internal satisfaction from the task itself.
        *   Examples: challenge, curiosity, sense of achievement, purpose.
        *   Impact: Higher quality work, creativity, sustained effort.
    *   **B. Extrinsic Motivation:**
        *   Definition: Driven by external rewards or punishments.
        *   Examples: salary, bonuses, praise, promotions, fear of negative consequences.
        *   Impact: Effective for specific behaviors, short-term goals.
    *   **C. The Interplay:** Balancing both; potential for extrinsic rewards to undermine intrinsic motivation (overjustification effect). Importance of fair baseline extrinsic rewards.
