    *   Link to how these roles function within Scrum events and manage artifacts (preview of next module).

**Potential Activities/Exercises:**
*   Scenario: A PO is unavailable. How should the team and SM handle it?
*   Debate: Is the Scrum Master a full-time role? Why or why not?
*   Identify skills needed for a cross-functional "Developers" group for a non-software product.

**Suggested Readings/Resources:**
*   The Scrum Guide (scrumguides.org).
*   "Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time" by Jeff Sutherland.
*   Articles from Scrum.org and Scrum Alliance on roles.
