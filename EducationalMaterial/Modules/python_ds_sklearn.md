## 1. Introduction: What is Machine Learning?
    *   **Defining Machine Learning (ML):** Learning from data without being explicitly programmed.
    *   **Relationship to AI, Data Science, and Statistics.**
    *   **Why ML?** Solving complex problems, automation, personalization, prediction.
    *   **Common Applications:** Image recognition, spam filtering, recommendation systems, medical diagnosis, financial forecasting.

## 2. Types of Machine Learning
    *   **A. Supervised Learning:**

        *   Goal: Learn a mapping function `f(X) = Y`.
        *   **Classification:** Predicting a categorical target (e.g., spam/not spam, cat/dog).
        *   **Regression:** Predicting a continuous numerical target (e.g., house price, temperature).
    *   **B. Unsupervised Learning:**
        *   Learning from unlabeled data (only input features X).
        *   Goal: Discover hidden patterns, structure, or relationships in the data.
        *   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points (e.g., customer segmentation).
        *   **Dimensionality Reduction:** Reducing the number of features while preserving information (e.g., PCA).
        *   **Association Rule Mining:** Finding relationships between items (e.g., market basket analysis).
    *   **C. Reinforcement Learning (Brief Overview):**
        *   Agent learns by interacting with an environment to maximize a cumulative reward.
        *   Trial and error, feedback through rewards/penalties.
        *   Examples: Game playing, robotics.
    *   *(This module focuses primarily on supervised and basic unsupervised learning).*

    *   **C. Bias-Variance Tradeoff (Conceptual Introduction):**
        *   Bias: Error from wrong assumptions. High bias -> underfitting.
        *   Variance: Error from sensitivity to training data fluctuations. High variance -> overfitting.
        *   The goal is to find a balance.
    *   **D. Cross-Validation (k-Fold CV - Basic Concept):**
        *   A more robust way to evaluate model performance by splitting training data into 'k' folds.
        *   `sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score`.
