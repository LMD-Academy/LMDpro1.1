## 1. Introduction: Articulating Value from the User's Perspective

In Agile development, particularly within frameworks like Scrum, effectively capturing and managing requirements is crucial for delivering value to the customer. User stories have emerged as a popular and effective technique for expressing requirements from the perspective of the end-user. Unlike traditional, lengthy requirements documents, user stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the viewpoint of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. They facilitate communication, promote shared understanding, and keep the focus on delivering value. Complementing user stories, acceptance criteria define the specific conditions that must be met for a story to be considered "Done." Furthermore, Agile teams need ways to estimate the effort involved in implementing these stories to plan their work effectively; relative estimation techniques like story points and Planning Poker provide practical approaches for this.

This module focuses on the art and science of crafting effective user stories, defining robust acceptance criteria, and applying Agile estimation techniques. We will explore the standard format for user stories, delve into the "3 Cs" that characterize their lifecycle, and apply the INVEST criteria to ensure stories are well-formed and actionable. You will learn how to write clear and testable acceptance criteria that provide the necessary detail for development and testing. We will also cover strategies for breaking down large requirements (Epics) into smaller, manageable user stories suitable for development within a single iteration or Sprint. Finally, we will demystify Agile estimation, explaining the concept of relative sizing using story points and providing hands-on insight into collaborative estimation techniques like Planning Poker. Mastering these skills is essential for Product Owners, Scrum Masters, Developers, and anyone involved in defining and delivering value in an Agile environment.

## 2. What is a User Story? Purpose and Benefits

A user story is a brief, informal description of a software feature written from the perspective of an end-user or customer. It captures *who* wants the feature, *what* they want, and *why* they want it. User stories are not detailed specifications; rather, they are placeholders for conversations about the desired functionality.

**Purpose of User Stories:**
*   **Focus on User Value:** Keeps the team centered on delivering functionality that benefits the user.
*   **Facilitate Communication & Collaboration:** Act as a common language and a starting point for discussions between the Product Owner, Developers, and stakeholders.
*   **Promote Shared Understanding:** Help ensure everyone has a clear and aligned understanding of what needs to be built.
*   **Enable Iterative Development:** Small, well-defined stories can be developed, tested, and delivered incrementally.
*   **Support Prioritization:** The "why" (benefit) part of a story helps in understanding its value and prioritizing it.
*   **Defer Detail:** Allow details to emerge through conversations closer to the time of implementation, embracing Agile's principle of responding to change.

**Benefits of Using User Stories:**
*   **Improved Customer Focus:** By writing from the user's perspective.
*   **Increased Collaboration:** They are invitations to conversation.
*   **Enhanced Clarity:** Simple, concise format.
*   **Greater Flexibility:** Easier to adapt and re-prioritize than lengthy requirements documents.
*   **Faster Feedback Loops:** Smaller stories lead to quicker delivery and feedback.
*   **Empowerment of the Team:** Developers are involved in understanding and implementing the stories.

## 3. The User Story Format and the "3 Cs"

**A. Common User Story Template:**
While variations exist, a widely adopted template, often attributed to Connextra, is:

`As a <type of user>, I want <to perform some action/achieve some goal> so that <I can get some benefit/value>.`

*   **`As a <type of user>` (The Role):** Identifies who will benefit from this feature. This should be a specific user role or persona (e.g., "Registered Customer," "Site Administrator," "Marketing Manager"). Understanding the user helps empathize with their needs.
*   **`I want <to perform some action/achieve some goal>` (The Goal/Functionality):** Describes what the user wants to be able to do with the system. This should be an action or a goal.
*   **`so that <I can get some benefit/value>` (The Benefit/Reason):** Explains the value or rationale behind the requested functionality. This is crucial for understanding the story's importance and for prioritization. It answers the "why."

**Example User Stories:**
*   "As a *shopper*, I want *to view product reviews* so that *I can make an informed purchase decision*."
*   "As an *administrator*, I want *to be able to reset user passwords* so that *I can assist users who are locked out*."
*   "As a *premium subscriber*, I want *to download articles for offline reading* so that *I can access content when I don't have an internet connection*."

**B. The "3 Cs" of User Stories (Ron Jeffries):**
The "3 Cs" describe the lifecycle and collaborative nature of user stories:

1.  **Card:**
    *   Traditionally, user stories were written on physical index cards or sticky notes. This emphasized their brevity and ability to be easily moved around for planning and prioritization.
    *   The "card" represents a tangible token for the requirement, a placeholder for the real conversation.
    *   Even with digital tools, the idea of a concise, manageable "card" remains.
2.  **Conversation:**
    *   The details behind the user story emerge through ongoing conversations between the Product Owner, Developers, and other relevant stakeholders.
    *   The story card is an invitation to these conversations. It's not meant to capture all the details upfront.
    *   This collaborative discussion clarifies requirements, uncovers assumptions, and ensures shared understanding.
3.  **Confirmation:**
    *   Acceptance criteria (discussed next) provide the confirmation that the story has been implemented correctly and delivers the intended value.
    *   Confirmation happens through testing and demonstration (e.g., during a Sprint Review).

*(Diagram: A simple visual showing three interconnected elements: a Card with a user story written on it, speech bubbles representing Conversation, and a checkmark representing Confirmation.)*

## 4. Characteristics of Good User Stories (INVEST)

The INVEST acronym, coined by Bill Wake, provides a useful checklist for evaluating the quality of user stories:

*   **I - Independent:** Stories should be as self-contained and independent of other stories as possible. This allows them to be developed, tested, and potentially released in any order, providing flexibility in prioritization and planning.
    *   *If dependencies exist, they should be made explicit.*
*   **N - Negotiable:** A user story is not a rigid contract. It's a starting point for discussion. The details and scope can be negotiated and refined through conversations between the Product Owner and the Development Team.
    *   *It's not about negotiating whether to do it, but how best to implement it and what "done" means.*
*   **V - Valuable:** Each story must deliver clear, demonstrable value to the end-user or the business. The "so that..." part of the story helps articulate this value. If a story doesn't provide value, it should be questioned.
*   **E - Estimable:** The Development Team must be able to understand the story well enough to estimate the effort required to implement it. If a story is too vague or too large, it will be difficult to estimate.
*   **S - Small (Sized Appropriately):** Stories should be small enough to be completed within a single iteration (Sprint in Scrum). Large stories (often called Epics) need to be broken down into smaller, more manageable stories. This facilitates flow and allows for faster feedback.
*   **T - Testable:** The story must be defined in a way that allows for clear criteria for testing its completion. This is where acceptance criteria come in. If you can't test it, you don't know when it's done.

Applying the INVEST criteria helps create well-formed user stories that are ready for development.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria (AC)

Acceptance Criteria (AC) are a set of predefined conditions or requirements that a specific user story must meet to be considered "Done" and acceptable to the Product Owner and stakeholders. They provide clarity on the expected outcome and behavior of the feature described in the user story.

**Purpose of Acceptance Criteria:**
*   **Clarify Scope:** Define the boundaries of the user story, making it clear what is included and what is not.
*   **Remove Ambiguity:** Ensure a shared understanding of what success looks like for the story.
*   **Provide a Basis for Testing:** Testers use ACs to create test cases and verify that the functionality works as expected.
*   **Confirm "Done":** Help the team and Product Owner agree on when a story is truly complete.
*   **Empower Developers:** Give developers a clear target for what they need to build.

**Writing Effective Acceptance Criteria:**
*   **Clear and Concise:** Easy to understand, unambiguous.
*   **Testable/Verifiable:** Each criterion should be something that can be objectively confirmed through testing (manual or automated). Avoid subjective terms like "user-friendly" without further definition.
*   **Focused on "What," Not "How":** Describe the expected outcome or behavior from a user's perspective, not the technical implementation details.
*   **Written Before Development Starts:** Ideally, ACs are defined during backlog refinement or Sprint Planning, before the Developers begin working on the story.
*   **Collaboratively Defined:** While the PO often drafts them, ACs are best defined collaboratively with input from Developers and testers to ensure feasibility and testability.

**Common Formats for Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  **Checklist Format (Scenario-based):** A simple list of conditions that must be true.
    *   *User Story:* "As a shopper, I want to add items to my shopping cart so that I can purchase them later."
    *   *Acceptance Criteria (Checklist):*
        *   [ ] I can add an item to the cart from the product page.
        *   [ ] The cart icon updates with the correct number of items.
        *   [ ] I can view the items in my cart.
        *   [ ] I can change the quantity of an item in the cart.
        *   [ ] I can remove an item from the cart.

2.  **Given/When/Then Format (Behavior-Driven Development - BDD style):** Describes behavior in a structured way.
    *   `Given` <some precondition or context>
    *   `When` <some action is carried out>
    *   `Then` <a particular observable outcome should occur>
    *   *User Story:* "As a registered user, I want to log in with my credentials so that I can access my account."
    *   *Acceptance Criteria (Given/When/Then):*
        *   Scenario 1: Successful Login
            *   `Given` I am on the login page
            *   `And` I have entered my valid username and password
            *   `When` I click the "Login" button
            *   `Then` I should be redirected to my account dashboard.
        *   Scenario 2: Invalid Password
            *   `Given` I am on the login page
            *   `And` I have entered a valid username
            *   `And` I have entered an invalid password
            *   `When` I click the "Login" button
            *   `Then` I should see an error message "Invalid username or password."
            *   `And` I should remain on the login page.

Well-defined acceptance criteria are crucial for ensuring quality and shared understanding.

## 6. Splitting User Stories (Epics to Stories)

Often, initial requirements are large and complex (these are sometimes called **Epics** or large features). To fit within Sprints and meet the "Small" and "Estimable" criteria of INVEST, these epics need to be broken down (split) into smaller, independent user stories.

**Why Split Stories?**
*   Allows for incremental delivery of value.
*   Makes estimation more accurate.
*   Reduces risk by tackling smaller pieces.
*   Provides more frequent feedback opportunities.
*   Helps maintain flow.

**Common Patterns for Splitting User Stories:**

1.  **By Workflow Steps:** Break down a process into its individual steps.
    *   *Epic:* "As a user, I want to manage my online order so that I can track its progress and make changes."
    *   *Stories:*
        *   "As a user, I want to view my order history so that I can see past purchases."
        *   "As a user, I want to track the shipment status of a current order so that I know when it will arrive."
        *   "As a user, I want to request a cancellation for an unfulfilled order so that I can change my mind."
2.  **By Business Rule Variations:** Different rules might lead to different stories.
    *   *Epic:* "As a customer, I want to apply a discount code to my order so that I can save money."
    *   *Stories:*
        *   "As a customer, I want to apply a percentage-based discount code..."
        *   "As a customer, I want to apply a fixed-amount discount code..."
        *   "As a customer, I want to be informed if a discount code is expired or invalid..."
3.  **By Happy Path vs. Unhappy Paths (Error Handling):** One story for the successful scenario, separate stories for error conditions or alternative flows.
    *   *Epic:* "As a user, I want to upload a profile picture."
    *   *Stories:*
        *   (Happy Path) "As a user, I want to upload a JPG image under 2MB as my profile picture..."
        *   (Error Path) "As a user, when I try to upload an image larger than 2MB, I want to see an error message..."
        *   (Error Path) "As a user, when I try to upload a non-JPG file, I want to see an error message..."
4.  **By Data Types or Parameters:** Variations in data can lead to separate stories.
    *   *Epic:* "As an admin, I want to search for users."
    *   *Stories:*
        *   "As an admin, I want to search for users by email address..."
        *   "As an admin, I want to search for users by username..."
        *   "As an admin, I want to search for users by registration date range..."
5.  **By Operations (CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete):** For managing a specific entity.
    *   *Epic:* "As an admin, I want to manage product categories."
    *   *Stories:*
        *   "As an admin, I want to create a new product category..."
        *   "As an admin, I want to view a list of all product categories..."
        *   "As an admin, I want to edit an existing product category..."
        *   "As an admin, I want to delete a product category..."
6.  **By User Roles or Personas:** Different users might need different aspects of a feature.
7.  **By breaking down into simpler sub-components that still deliver value.**

The goal of splitting is to arrive at stories that are small enough to be completed in a Sprint, deliver distinct value, and are testable. It's an art that improves with practice and team collaboration.

## 7. Agile Estimation: Story Points and Relative Sizing

Agile estimation focuses on providing quick, reasonably accurate estimates of the effort required to complete Product Backlog Items, primarily for planning purposes. Instead of estimating in absolute time units (like hours or days), which can be unreliable and vary between individuals, many Agile teams use **relative estimation** with **story points**.

**Why Relative Estimation?**
*   Humans are generally better at comparing the relative size of things than at predicting absolute duration. (e.g., "Is this task bigger or smaller than that task?" is easier than "How many hours will this task take?").
*   Accounts for all factors affecting effort (complexity, uncertainty, risk, amount of work), not just time.
*   Decouples estimation from individual skill levels (a story point represents a fixed amount of "effort," regardless of who does it).
*   Promotes team discussion and shared understanding.

**Story Points:**
*   A unitless measure of the relative effort required to implement a user story.
*   Often uses a modified Fibonacci sequence (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100) or similar non-linear scale to reflect the increasing uncertainty with larger items. The gaps encourage teams to break down very large items.
*   **Not directly convertible to hours.** The actual time taken can vary, but the relative effort compared to other stories should be consistent.
*   A team establishes a baseline: they pick a small, well-understood story and assign it a low point value (e.g., 2 points). Other stories are then estimated relative to this baseline.

**Team Velocity:**
*   The average number of story points a team completes per Sprint.
*   Calculated based on historical data from past Sprints.
*   Used for forecasting how much work the team can likely take on in future Sprints and for release planning.
*   **Important:** Velocity is a measure for the team's planning purposes, not a performance metric for comparing teams or individuals.

## 8. Planning Poker: A Collaborative Estimation Technique

Planning Poker® (a registered trademark of Mountain Goat Software) is a consensus-based, gamified technique used by Agile teams to estimate the effort of Product Backlog Items, typically in story points.

**Process:**

1.  **Preparation:**
    *   Each team member has a deck of cards with story point values (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100, ?, coffee cup).
    *   The Product Owner presents a user story to be estimated.
2.  **Discussion:**
    *   The PO explains the story and answers clarifying questions from the Developers.
    *   The team discusses requirements, potential technical approaches, complexities, and uncertainties.
3.  **Individual Estimation:**
    *   Each Developer privately selects a card representing their estimate of the effort for the story.
4.  **Reveal:**
    *   Everyone reveals their chosen card simultaneously.
5.  **Convergence/Discussion:**
    *   If estimates are similar, a consensus value might be agreed upon quickly (e.g., the average or most common value).
    *   If estimates vary significantly (high and low outliers):
        *   The individuals with the highest and lowest estimates explain their reasoning. This often uncovers different assumptions, missed details, or varying perspectives on complexity.
        *   The team discusses these points further.
6.  **Re-estimate:**
    *   The team re-estimates (steps 3-5) until a consensus or a reasonably close range of estimates is reached. The goal is not perfect agreement but a shared understanding and a reasonable estimate.
7.  **Record Estimate:** The agreed-upon story point value is assigned to the user story.

**Benefits of Planning Poker:**
*   Encourages participation from all team members.
*   Leverages collective wisdom and diverse perspectives.
*   Facilitates discussion and shared understanding of requirements.
*   Helps identify hidden assumptions and complexities.
*   Faster than some other detailed estimation techniques.
*   Makes estimation more engaging ("gamified").

The Product Owner participates in discussions to clarify but does not estimate (as they don't do the implementation work). The Scrum Master often facilitates the Planning Poker session.

## 9. Conclusion & Next Steps

Mastering the art of writing effective user stories, defining clear acceptance criteria, and employing Agile estimation techniques are fundamental skills for any successful Agile team, especially for Product Owners and Developers. User stories keep the focus on user value, acceptance criteria ensure clarity on "Done," and relative estimation helps in planning and forecasting. These practices foster collaboration, shared understanding, and the ability to deliver value incrementally.

As you move forward, practice writing stories and ACs for various scenarios. Participate in or facilitate estimation sessions. Remember that these are skills that improve with experience and continuous feedback within the team. The goal is not perfection in documentation or estimation, but effective communication and a shared understanding that enables the team to build the right product, the right way.

**Potential Activities/Exercises:**
*   Take an existing traditional requirement and rewrite it as one or more user stories using the "As a..., I want..., so that..." format.
*   For one of the user stories you wrote, draft at least three acceptance criteria (using checklist or Given/When/Then format).
*   Critique a poorly written user story: How could it be improved using the INVEST criteria?
*   With a small group, try a quick Planning Poker session for 3-4 simple, commonly understood tasks (e.g., "Write a thank-you note," "Prepare a simple meal," "Plan a weekend trip"). Discuss why estimates might differ.
*   Consider a large feature for a product you know. Practice splitting it into 3-5 smaller, valuable user stories.

## 1. Introduction: Python as the Bedrock and NumPy for Numerical Power

Python has become the de facto programming language for data science, machine learning, and scientific computing due to its readability, extensive ecosystem of libraries, and large community. Before diving into specialized data science libraries like Pandas or Scikit-learn, a solid understanding of core Python concepts and, critically, proficiency with NumPy (Numerical Python) is essential. NumPy is the fundamental package for numerical computation in Python. It provides a powerful N-dimensional array object, sophisticated (broadcasting) functions, tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code, and useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities. Many data science libraries, including Pandas, are built on top of NumPy arrays, leveraging their efficiency for numerical operations.

This module serves two primary purposes. First, it provides a focused recap of core Python programming fundamentals that are particularly relevant for data manipulation and analysis tasks. This includes a review of data types, data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets), control flow, and functions. Second, and more extensively, it introduces the NumPy library. You will learn why NumPy is crucial for numerical tasks, how to create and manipulate its core `ndarray` object, and perform a wide range of operations, from basic arithmetic to more complex linear algebra. We will cover essential concepts like array indexing, slicing, reshaping, and the powerful broadcasting feature that allows operations on arrays of different shapes. By the end of this module, you will have a strong grasp of NumPy's capabilities, enabling you to perform efficient numerical computations and preparing you for data manipulation with Pandas and subsequent machine learning tasks.

## 2. Python Fundamentals Review for Data Science

A quick refresher on Python concepts crucial for data science.

**A. Basic Data Types:**
*   **Integers (`int`):** Whole numbers (e.g., `10`, `-3`, `0`).
*   **Floating-point numbers (`float`):** Numbers with a decimal point (e.g., `3.14`, `-0.001`, `2.0`).
*   **Strings (`str`):** Sequences of characters, enclosed in single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes (e.g., `"hello"`, `'data science'`).
    *   Common methods: `upper()`, `lower()`, `split()`, `join()`, `replace()`, `find()`, `startswith()`, `endswith()`, f-strings for formatting.
*   **Booleans (`bool`):** Represent truth values, `True` or `False`. Often result from comparison operations.

**B. Core Data Structures:**
*   **Lists (`list`):** Ordered, mutable (changeable) collections of items. Can hold items of different types. Defined with `[]`.
    *   `my_list = [1, "a", 2.5, True]`
    *   Indexing: `my_list[0]`
    *   Slicing: `my_list[1:3]`
    *   Methods: `append()`, `insert()`, `remove()`, `pop()`, `sort()`, `len()`.
*   **Tuples (`tuple`):** Ordered, immutable (unchangeable) collections. Defined with `()`.
    *   `my_tuple = (1, "a", 2.5)`
    *   Use cases: When data should not change (e.g., coordinates, records from a database).
*   **Dictionaries (`dict`):** Unordered (ordered in Python 3.7+) collections of key-value pairs. Mutable. Defined with `{}`. Keys must be unique and immutable.
    *   `my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}`
    *   Accessing values: `my_dict["age"]` or `my_dict.get("age")`.
    *   Adding/updating: `my_dict["email"] = "alice@example.com"`.
    *   Methods: `keys()`, `values()`, `items()`.
*   **Sets (`set`):** Unordered collections of unique, immutable items. Mutable. Defined with `{}` or `set()`.
    *   `my_set = {1, 2, 2, 3, "apple"}` results in `{1, 2, 3, "apple"}`.
    *   Use cases: Membership testing, removing duplicates, set operations (union, intersection, difference).

**C. Control Flow:**
*   **Conditional Statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`):**
    ```python
    x = 10
    if x > 5:
        print("x is greater than 5")
    elif x == 5:
        print("x is 5")
    else:
        print("x is less than 5")
    ```
*   **Loops:**
    *   `for` loop (iterating over sequences):
        ```python
        numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        for num in numbers:
            print(num * 2)
        for i in range(5): # 0 to 4
            print(i)
        ```
    *   `while` loop (executing as long as a condition is true):
        ```python
        count = 0
        while count < 3:
            print(f"Count: {count}")
            count += 1
        ```
    *   `break` (exit loop), `continue` (skip to next iteration).

**D. Functions:**
*   Reusable blocks of code.
    ```python
    def greet(name="World"): # Default parameter value
        return f"Hello, {name}!"

    message = greet("Data Scientist")
    print(message) # Output: Hello, Data Scientist!
    print(greet())   # Output: Hello, World!
    ```
*   **Lambda Functions (Anonymous Functions):** Small, single-expression functions.
    ```python
    add = lambda a, b: a + b
    print(add(3, 5)) # Output: 8
    ```
*   **`*args` and `**kwargs`:** For functions that accept a variable number of positional or keyword arguments.

**E. List Comprehensions:** Concise way to create lists.
    ```python
    squares = [x**2 for x in range(1, 6)] # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
    even_numbers = [x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0] # [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
    ```
Dictionary and set comprehensions also exist.

## 3. Introduction to NumPy: Why It's Essential

NumPy (Numerical Python) is the cornerstone library for numerical computing in Python.
*   **Core Object: `ndarray` (N-dimensional array):** A fast, flexible, and memory-efficient array object that allows for storing and manipulating homogeneous data (all elements of the same type, usually numbers).
*   **Performance:** NumPy operations are implemented in C and Fortran, making them much faster than equivalent operations on Python lists, especially for large datasets. This is due to:
    *   **Vectorization:** NumPy allows you to perform operations on entire arrays (or sections of arrays) without explicit Python loops. These vectorized operations are executed by pre-compiled C code.
    *   **Contiguous Memory Storage:** NumPy arrays store data in a continuous block of memory, enabling more efficient access and caching by the CPU.
*   **Functionality:** Provides a vast collection of mathematical functions, random number generators, linear algebra routines, Fourier transforms, and more.
*   **Foundation for Other Libraries:** Many key data science libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and SciPy are built on top of NumPy and use its arrays as their fundamental data structure for numerical data.

```python
import numpy as np

python_list = list(range(1_000_000))
numpy_array = np.arange(1_000_000)

# %timeit [x*2 for x in python_list]  # In Jupyter Notebook to measure time
# %timeit numpy_array * 2             # In Jupyter Notebook to measure time
# Typically, the NumPy operation will be significantly faster.
```

## 4. Creating NumPy Arrays

There are several ways to create NumPy `ndarray` objects:

**A. From Python Lists or Tuples:**
```python
import numpy as np

list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr1 = np.array(list1)
print(f"arr1: {arr1}, type: {arr1.dtype}") # dtype will be int

list2 = [1.0, 2.5, 3.3]
arr2 = np.array(list2)
print(f"arr2: {arr2}, type: {arr2.dtype}") # dtype will be float

# Multi-dimensional array from a list of lists
list_of_lists = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
arr_2d = np.array(list_of_lists)
print(f"arr_2d:\n{arr_2d}")
print(f"Shape: {arr_2d.shape}, Dimensions: {arr_2d.ndim}") # (2, 3), 2
```
NumPy infers the data type (`dtype`) from the input. You can also specify it explicitly: `np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=np.float64)`.

**B. Using Built-in NumPy Array Creation Functions:**
*   `np.zeros(shape)`: Creates an array of the given shape filled with zeros.
    ```python
    zeros_arr = np.zeros((2, 3)) # Creates a 2x3 array of zeros
    print(f"zeros_arr:\n{zeros_arr}")
    ```
*   `np.ones(shape)`: Creates an array of the given shape filled with ones.
    ```python
    ones_arr = np.ones((3, 2), dtype=int) # Creates a 3x2 array of integer ones
    print(f"ones_arr:\n{ones_arr}")
    ```
*   `np.full(shape, fill_value)`: Creates an array of the given shape filled with a specified value.
    ```python
    full_arr = np.full((2, 2), 7.5)
    print(f"full_arr:\n{full_arr}")
    ```
*   `np.empty(shape)`: Creates an array of the given shape without initializing its entries (faster, but entries are arbitrary).
*   `np.arange(start, stop, step)`: Like Python's `range()`, but returns a NumPy array. `stop` is exclusive.
    ```python
    range_arr = np.arange(0, 10, 2) # [0 2 4 6 8]
    print(f"range_arr: {range_arr}")
    ```
*   `np.linspace(start, stop, num)`: Creates an array of `num` evenly spaced values between `start` and `stop` (inclusive of `stop`).
    ```python
    linspace_arr = np.linspace(0, 1, 5) # [0.   0.25 0.5  0.75 1.  ]
    print(f"linspace_arr: {linspace_arr}")
    ```
*   `np.eye(N)` or `np.identity(N)`: Creates an N x N identity matrix.
*   `np.random.rand(d0, d1, ...)`: Creates an array of the given shape with random samples from a uniform distribution over [0, 1).
*   `np.random.randn(d0, d1, ...)`: Creates an array with samples from a standard normal distribution (mean 0, variance 1).
*   `np.random.randint(low, high, size)`: Creates an array of random integers.

**C. Array Attributes:**
Every NumPy array has important attributes:
*   `ndarray.ndim`: The number of axes (dimensions) of the array.
*   `ndarray.shape`: A tuple of integers indicating the size of the array in each dimension. For a matrix with `n` rows and `m` columns, `shape` will be `(n, m)`.
*   `ndarray.size`: The total number of elements in the array. Equal to the product of the elements of `shape`.
*   `ndarray.dtype`: An object describing the type of the elements in the array (e.g., `int64`, `float64`, `bool`).
*   `ndarray.itemsize`: The size in bytes of each element of the array.
*   `ndarray.data`: The buffer containing the actual elements of the array (usually not accessed directly).

## 5. Array Indexing and Slicing

Accessing and modifying parts of NumPy arrays.

**A. Basic Indexing (1-D Arrays):** Similar to Python lists.
```python
arr = np.arange(10) # [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
print(arr[5])       # Output: 5
arr[5] = 50
print(arr)          # Output: [ 0  1  2  3  4 50  6  7  8  9]
```

**B. Basic Indexing (Multi-Dimensional Arrays):** Use a tuple of indices.
```python
arr2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
print(arr2d[1, 2])  # Access element at row 1, column 2. Output: 6
print(arr2d[0])     # Access the entire first row. Output: [1 2 3]
arr2d[0, 0] = 100
print(arr2d)
# [[100   2   3]
#  [  4   5   6]
#  [  7   8   9]]
```

**C. Slicing:** Extracts subarrays. Similar to Python list slicing, but can be applied to multiple dimensions.
`arr[start:stop:step]`
*   Slices are *views* on the original array, not copies. Modifying a slice will modify the original array. Use `.copy()` to create a distinct copy.
```python
arr = np.arange(10) # [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
slice1 = arr[2:5]   # Elements from index 2 up to (but not including) 5. Output: [2 3 4]
print(slice1)
slice1[1] = 333
print(arr)          # Original array is modified: [  0   1   2 333   4   5   6   7   8   9]

arr2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12]])
# Slice rows 0 and 1, columns 1 and 2
slice2d = arr2d[:2, 1:3]
print(f"slice2d:\n{slice2d}")
# [[2 3]
#  [6 7]]

# Slice a single row (returns a 1D array)
row_slice = arr2d[1, :] # Row at index 1, all columns
print(f"row_slice: {row_slice}") # [5 6 7 8]

# Slice a single column (returns a 1D array)
col_slice = arr2d[:, 2] # All rows, column at index 2
print(f"col_slice: {col_slice}") # [ 3  7 11]
```

**D. Boolean Indexing:** Select elements based on a boolean condition. The boolean array must have the same shape
