## 2. Formulating the Enterprise Human Capital Strategy

The human capital strategy is the enterprise-wide plan for ensuring the organization has the talent, leadership, and culture it needs to win in the marketplace.
*   **From HR Strategy to Human Capital Strategy:** A shift in language and scope. It's not just about the HR function; it's about the entire organization's approach to its people.
*   **Integration with Corporate Strategy:** The process begins with the business strategy. The CHRO works with the C-suite to answer: "What talent, leadership, and cultural capabilities must we have to execute our business strategy and achieve our financial goals?"
*   **Key Pillars:**
    *   **Talent:** How will we attract, develop, and retain the critical talent needed for the future?
    *   **Leadership:** How will we build a pipeline of leaders with the capabilities to lead the organization tomorrow?
    *   **Culture:** What are the desired cultural attributes that will enable our strategy, and how will we cultivate them?
    *   **Organization:** How do we design the organization and ways of working to maximize agility, collaboration, and performance?
